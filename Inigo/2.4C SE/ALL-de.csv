Today I had to kill Felix with his own damned sword.  Fool attacked me!  He was planning to murder me for the last of the skooma.  He did not ask, did not enquire, he just burst into my room with a shriek and started slicing.  Poor wretch had been clean for days. He got me in the leg before I could finish him. A little extra skooma will take the edge off the pain tonight.  Selling the rest tomorrow.  I am done with the stuff.  ;
[pagebreak];
Entry Two;
;
I am missing Felix today.  Shame I had to kill him.  Could not find a buyer for the stuff but I did meet a fancy man called Dupan at the docks earlier.  He says he has a job for me and that it is well paid.  I will be working with another mercenary.  I hope whoever it is respects my property.  I am to meet Dupan and my new partner next week in Skyrim.  I always knew destiny would bring me back there.;
[pagebreak];
Entry Three;
;
I sometimes hear Felix talking to me even though I know he is dead. He blames me for killing him.  I blame him for being a bloody skooma addict!;
[pagebreak];
Entry Four;
;
He is back again, whispering from the shadows. You did not have to murder me, Inigo!  Shut up. You should have just listened to me, Inigo! Shut up, Felix! Stop haunting me!  I was clean for days, Inigo.  It is you who is the addict!  Quiet.  Please be quiet.  I was not going to kill you, Inigo.  I was going to help you.  No! You lie! You were a skooma head! You stole from me more than once to feed your habit! A habit we share, Inigo.;
[pagebreak];
Entry Five;
;
The skooma is all gone.  It was the only thing keeping Felix quiet.  I need to get more before the big job...  Am I an addict?  Felix, leave me be! I am sorry!;
[pagebreak];
Entry Six;
;
Lucky, lucky me.  I found a dealer this morning before I met my new companion.  It is not good stuff and I only had enough gold to buy a little but it will have to do.;
[pagebreak];
Entry Seven;
;
My partner seems likely enough. We can certainly get the job done that is for sure.  We got into a bit of a scuffle with some thugs and... well I am glad I was not one of them.  I think we will make a good team.  The air is so fresh here.  This land is very beautiful.  My new friend is off catching dinner.  Felix has been quiet all day.  ;
[pagebreak];
Entry Eight;
;
We met with Dupan and his sister today.  Yes, he has a sister! A very pretty lady indeed.  It turns out that Dupan has two brothers as well.  We are to track and kill them both.  Dupan is the youngest but feels he is more deserving of their fathers inheritance.  He says all they do is drink and fight and dirty the family name.  We are going to be paid very well for this.  My companion wants to buy a house with the takings.  All I can think about is skooma.  Dupan says that if only one of us makes it back the survivor will get the full reward.  What a thing to say!  Now we will be watching our backs when we should be protecting each other.  ;
[pagebreak];
Entry Nine;
;
We set off at dawn heading north.  We should get to the first keep in a few days.  My partner and I shared many stories and even sang a little as we travelled.  I think we are becoming friends.  I used the last of the skooma today.  Oh what I would do to never have this worry and want again!   ;
[pagebreak];
Entry Ten;
;
Felix is back but quieter than before.  Maybe I can kick the habit this time. I have good company and gold on the way.  We were attacked by a pack of ugly wolves this afternoon.  My friend took care of most of them but I got two.  I think we trust each other.  What a powerful ally I have made.  My hands have begun to shake a little but I will suffer it.  Hush now Felix.  Hush.;
[pagebreak];
Entry Eleven;
;
Brother one is no more! He was an evil piece of work but stupid as a rock.  He did not seem to notice half his men were dead until I put my dagger to his throat.  We found a poor serving girl tied up in his bed chamber.  We released her and the other servants before we burned the place down.  As long as word doesn't reach the next brother before we do all will be well.  I am very sick.  My new friend knows something is up.  On the up side Felix has been quiet all day.;
[pagebreak];
Entry Twelve;
;
I have decided to go back on the skooma as soon as possible.  It is only a problem when I don't have it.  With my share of our reward I will not have to worry about wanting for ten years... maybe more.  My companion has grown less talkative. I am  ill but on my feet.  Mood swings... sweats.  I fear my friend is growing wary of me.  I may wake up dead tomorrow.  It may be a relief.  Felix is gone I think.  ;
[pagebreak];
Entry Thirteen;
;
I was not killed in the night.  My companion is packing up our camp.  I am too weak.  We are about to take on brother number two, but hardly a word passes between us...  If only one of us returns the reward is double... This is what my friend is thinking.  I could not defend myself in this state.  I must make the first move.  I must put some distance between us and use my bow from cover.  I am a wretch and a fool but I will not die today!  If I do this right I will not have to worry about wanting for twenty years, maybe more.;

I'm not cut out for this. Bleeding beard's frozen solid, one of my toes -the big piggy on the left- is turning black, and we've eaten nothing but rat for the past three days. Dhavid says I'll forget all the pain and discomfort once my pockets are full of gold. Easy for him to say, he's the one that gets to sit up top next to the fire!;
;
Still no sign of the contact we're supposedly meeting in this cursed tower. Poor bleeder probably died on his way here. Plenty of things out there'll end a man if he's not careful. Maybe we should go out and have a look-see. Nah. Better stay here and stick to the plan.;
;
Anyways, I don't much want to meet that angry wizard fella again. The bleeder showed up here a few nights back complaining about our singing! We were working through the last of the mead and he just strode in all angry and whatnot. Said we were keeping him awake. Must live near here I guess. Of course we told him to hand over his valuables. Next thing we knew his hands were full of fire and he almost toasted us alive!  ;
;
Hang about. I think I hear someone coming. Doesn't sound much like the wizard (not enough angry shouting).;
;
If it's not the bleeding contact carrying the finest bleeding skooma I've ever bleeding tasted there'll be bleeding murder!;

That's it done. Leah and I are retired. No more contracts, no more blades in the dark, and no more sneaking about. Leah says I'll soon grow tired of a normal life but I'm not sure. I think I've seen all the death I care to. Now it's time to settle down and spend some of the gold we've saved. So meet the new us. Just an honest couple doing honest work.;

Entry Two;
;
We've just bought a house in Riverhold. Life is good here. It's peaceful enough and quite pretty in its own way. Most of the locals are pleasant and far more accepting than we were expecting. It's a very cosmopolitan place with all the border trading that goes on. No one seems to mind the idea of an Argonian and a Khajiit living together.;
;
Our new home is next door to the town orphanage and Leah keeps bringing it up in conversation. She wants a family. I'll be honest, the idea terrifies me. Is it possible that a couple of trained assassins like us could be good parents? I don't know.;
;
Entry Three;
;
I'm working a local mine and Leah just got a job at the orphanage! We went there yesterday. I think I'm going to be a father. We saw two little Khajiit boys that melted our hearts. They are supposedly twins but one is golden and the other is an unusual shade of blue. Seeing Leah with the boys... I don't know... it just felt right. We discussed adopting them all night. She said that if it was only down to her, she'd go and collect them now. I told Leah I had to think about it but I'm fairly sure my mind is made up. She is going to be an amazing mother. I love her more than words can say and can deny her nothing. I'll lock all our weapons in the basement and get to work on making the spare room baby proof.;
[pagebreak];
<img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Leah-Babies.png' height='471' width='296'>;
Entry Four;
;
We are now proud parents! We've named the boys Fergus and Inigo after our favourite former guild mates. The woman at the orphanage told us the little she knew of their past. A soldier found Inigo and Fergus in an abandoned shack about fifty miles from here. He heard them crying as he took shelter and discovered the boys wrapped in linen rags, half hidden in a pile of straw. The boys had a letter tucked between them. It was from their birth mother. We were shown the letter but it was ragged and torn so I asked if I could make a copy for posterity. It reads -;
"<font color=""#871114""></color>";
"""Atala hopes you have found her children safe. They are twins, born only minutes apart, though as you can see they are unalike.";
;
What had been a pleasant day began to darken at the time of their birth, and I heard much wailing and commotion outside my tent. My first son came then, but by the time his little brother entered the world the sky outside was like night. I held them in my arms and it was as if their cries brought back the sun, for then the darkness lifted and the voices outside rejoiced. I smiled and wondered if a third moon had appeared during my labour, as such a thing is said to signal the arrival of a Mane. Wishful Atala. Stupid Atala. Cursed Atala. There had been no third moon, only darkness.;
;
A few weeks later my youngest sprouted his first blue hair and his fate was decided. It has been nearly a hundred years since the last bad moon omen, but upon seeing that tiny blue strand our elder recognised its meaning. The village would suffer greatly unless my baby was put to death. Alas, Atala could not allow it.;
;
I can no longer trust the father of my children, the moons hold greater sway over his heart than we do. Our situation fills him with great sadness, but he is elder born and wishes to appease Masser and Secunda above all else.;
"The night before the sacrifice I heard a woman's voice speak, though no woman could be seen. The voice was fair but commanding. It said ""Run, Atala. The way is clear. Take your babies and flee."" I bundled up my little ones and snuck away into the desert. I have travelled many miles but my people are tracking us and they grow close. They will have blood one way or another. I would rather it were mine.  ";
;
"Earlier the woman's voice spoke up again inside my head. She said I must go now and draw our pursuers away from this place. She said my children will be found here by one who can help them. As strange as it sounds, I believe her. Please take my darlings to safety, and when they are old enough to understand, tell them that Atala loves them still.""";
"<font color=""#000000""></color>";
Leah says that she has never heard of such a barbarically pious tribe in her homeland, but the existence of such people does not surprise her. There are stories of forgotten settlements that still thrive in isolation among the shifting sands. Atala must have hailed from such a place. Her plan worked and now her boys are safe and loved. Leah and I will do our upmost to give them the best of everything.;
;
When they are old enough, we will tell the boys about their mother and what she endured to save their lives. It is a sad tale, and I am not sure if we will ever tell them absolutely everything. That is a worry for another day. Here and now they are happy and they make us happy. Long may it last.;
[pagebreak];
Entry Five;
;
Leah and I are just back from a job. I know! I know! We're retired, but it was good to flex those old muscles again and it was only a group of outlaws. The thugs had been terrorising a village a few miles away so we waited until dark, left the boys at the orphanage with one of Leah's co-workers, tooled up, and took care of business. By the Hist it felt good! I must admit my armour is getting a little snug but it seems Leah and I are as good a team as ever. I love her so much. When we returned to the orphanage, Leah's friend led us to the basement where Inigo and Fergus were chasing spiders. They looked so adorable I had to draw them.;
<img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Baby-Fergus-Inigo-spider.png' height='471' width='296'>;
[pagebreak];
Entry Six;
;
We've decided to teach the boys how to handle themselves. I'm sure many would say they are too young for weapons but it's a harsh world out there and we both agree they'll be better off with a little training. Inigo instantly took a shine to archery while Fergus seems to favour the sword. They both show great aptitude even at such a young age! I'm a very proud father. Fergus is already turning into a determined and thoughtful boy. Inigo has amazing reflexes and a sense of the absurd that often has the rest of us laughing even when we shouldn't be. Most importantly, the brothers are fiercely loyal. They often fight and squabble, but at the slightest hint of danger, they unflinchingly stand up for one another.;
;
When I'm down the mine the boys spend most of their days at the orphanage with Leah. It's sad but you could say they never really left. Ah well. I see no harm and they often cheer up the other children.;
<img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Fergus-Inigo-fight.png' height='471' width='296'>;
;
Entry Seven;
;
Poor Inigo had a bit of trouble at the market today. Some local boys and girls were making fun of him because of his blue fur! Little hooligans! If he'd had his bow with him I think he would have taught them a thing or two. If Fergus had been there things could have gotten ugly. We don't want either of the boys seriously hurting anyone so Leah showed them a few hand to hand tricks just in case things get rough. We adults often forget what a battleground childhood can be. I spoke to the parents of the boy who instigated the bullying. The father said his son wasn't responsible and called me a filthy lizard! Maybe this town isn't as open minded as we first thought.   ;
[pagebreak];
Entry Eight;
;
Leah discovered Fergus and Inigo playing with our most precious weapons today. I have no idea how they got the display cases open! Luckily Inigo is still too weak to draw Lightning, and Thunder is too heavy for them to wield. Can you imagine if either had discharged in the house! We locked the weapons away in a safer place. We have to keep an eye on those boys!;
;
[pagebreak];
Entry Nine;
;
Sadness and excitement today. Riverhold lost three people to a large group of migrating giant spiders. Leah and I knew we were the only ones capable of helping so we strapped on our weapons and exterminated the beasts. To be honest the boys did most of the work. They were eager to test their weapons on live targets and I must say they did fantastically well. As the villagers hid in their homes Leah and I dispatched about ten of the beasts, then watched as Inigo and Fergus took care of the rest. They fought efficiently and with great zeal. Fergus became a quiet whirlwind of deadly steel as Inigo expertly loosed a storm of arrows and insults. That boy would joke on the gallows! They are young men now and they are already talking about leaving Riverhold to seek their fortune. I would rather my children sought a more sedentary occupation but they clearly wish to use their skill to help others who are less able. I'm confident that as long as they have each other they will be safe.;
<img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/InigomFergus-Spider.png' height='471' width='296'>;
Entry Ten;
;
Our little boys are now men. It feels like only yesterday they were just fuzzy little bundles. Leah and I have agreed to let them travel the land in search of their fortune. They leave behind two extremely proud parents. We are gifting them our most prised weapons. Inigo will take Lightning - Leah's bow. Fergus will take Thunder - my sword. May they protect our children and strike fear into the hearts of all who oppose them.;
<img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Thunder-and-Lightning.png' height='471' width='296'>;
I better stop writing and help them pack. Dearest Fergus and Inigo, come back safe and happy. I miss you already.;
[pagebreak];
Entry Eleven;
;
They are gone. Our boys, our sons, our greatest achievement. Leah and I are already growing restless rattling around this empty house. Everything is the same, but everything has changed. They will return in a few years, and I cannot wait to see the men they will surely have become. Until that day we'll keep the fire stoked and their rooms ready.;
[pagebreak];
Entry Twelve;
;
A courier brought us news from the boys today! It's been over a year since they last sent word. They are well and happy. They say they have had many adventures and are now heading to Cyrodiil. They have caught the travelling bug and want to see as much of Tamriel as they can before coming home. I'm so glad they are alright. The letter has put us in a fantastic mood. Leah and I went to the Inn and had a few drinks. We spent most of the night toasting our boys repeatedly. They are happy, they are safe, and they are together. All is well.;
[pagebreak];
Entry Thirteen;
;
We haven't heard from Inigo and Fergus in a long time but I'm sure they're OK. There is a lot of world out there to explore. Let them have their fill of it before returning. They are not the only ones who feel the call of the road. Leah and I are growing tired of our inactive lifestyle. Perhaps we can go on a little trip of our own. Something with a bit of risk and adventure. It has been far too long.;
[pagebreak];
Entry Fourteen;
;
Adventure has found us! I can't wait to hit the road again! A trading caravan passed through town today and they were looking for guards. It's perfect. A bit of travel, a bit of adventure, and who knows, we may even bump into Fergus and Inigo. We join the group tomorrow. Leah is choosing her armour at the moment. I think we should each take a light and heavy set. It sounds like we could be passing through bandit territory. Nothing we can't handle I'm sure. Leah is calling me. I had better get my things together.;

Dreams;
;
Ever since I was a child I've had the gift of foresight. At the age of six I awoke from a dream in which I saw our cattle being slaughtered by a group of monstrous beasts, all slashing claws and ripping teeth. I could smell the thick, metallic stench of blood as I awoke screaming. My father led me outside to prove that our livestock were safe. They were all there at the bottom of the field, alive and well. We went back indoors. I was fussed over, reassured, and then tucked back into bed.;
<img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Dreams.png' height='471' width='296'>;
Early one morning about a week later, my father found our whole heard slaughtered. They had been killed by a pack of giant wolves. The entire field was red with cow's blood. I soon learned to listen to my dreams and for many years my gift has served me well. Specifics are often frustratingly hazy, but if I have a vision it almost always comes to pass... unless I somehow intervene.;
;
I've had countless visions over the years, but there is one that has outlasted all the rest. Since I was a young man my sleep has been plagued by a persistent nightmarish apparition. I have named this being The Doom Strider because in my dreams it brings anguish, grief, and pain wherever it walks. I have decided to dedicate my life to finding the one person my dreams tell me can vanquish this great evil.;
[pagebreak];
;
The Doom Strider;
;
In my dreams a hateful shadowy figure strides through our lands casting all asunder.;
I see Tamriel transformed to a tortured ruin. I see thousands of innocent lives destroyed. I hear screams of agony, the weeping of children, and the hopeless pray to gods that can no longer intervene. This is not a mere nightmare... it is a vision! How long do we have before this thing, this agent of annihilation appears? I know not. All I know is that there is one who can help us.  There is still hope.;
<img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Doom-StriderFade.png' height='471' width='296'>;
;
The champion;
;
In my dreams I see a champion unlike any other. A Khajiit that should not be, he escaped death in his first year, and has been successfully eluding it ever since. He is bold and fierce, but also kind and loyal. Like all Khajiit his appearance was decided by the moons at his birth, but he is the product of an extremely rare celestial alignment. The heavens have gifted him bluish fur, great strength, sharp eyes, and according to my visions, the power to destroy the Doom Strider. I must find the champion before it is too late.  ;
<img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Champion.png' height='471' width='296'>;
;
Progress;
;
The dreams are more frequent than ever but I think I'm making progress. I procured a travellers journal that may describe our champion's place of birth. In the Khajiit homeland there is a tiny village, completely cut off from the modern world. The birth of a blue Khajiit is significant in their folklore. Every 200 years or so a child is born who turns blue a few weeks after birth. The appearance of a blue baby is seen as a bad moon omen and these bloodthirsty zealots sacrifice the infant as soon as they get their first blue hair! <img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Sacrifice.png' height='471' width='296'>I can only assume that the champion in my vision somehow escaped his fate. Maybe he was smuggled away by a family member. I'll travel to Elsweyr and visit every settlement in the vicinity of the village. Maybe I'll get lucky.;
;
Our hero has a name;
;
Inigo! His name is Inigo! After many months of travel my search has led me to the town of Riverhold. Apparently there was a blue Khajiit here but he left to seek his fortune years ago. He and his brother were abandoned at the orphanage and later adopted by a local couple. This all happened a long time ago.  Inigo and his brother are likely grown men by now. Alas, his parents recently left town with a trading caravan. I must speak with them. I'll follow their trail and see if they know where their son is. From what I've heard his foster parents are strange, but pleasant people. I'm sure they'll help me if they can.  Inigo's brother is called Fergus and Inigo's mother is called Leah. Oddly, his father is Argonian. His name is Da Vinci.;
;
A tragedy;
;
I found the trading caravan this morning among a litter of corpses. It has been ransacked. Everyone is dead. Damned bandits! The filthy thieves paid a price though. At least 16 of their number were killed in the attack. I wept when I found Leah and Da Vinci. They died holding hands, heads resting brow to brow.  Poor Inigo and Fergus don't yet know the tragedy that has befallen them. At least they have each other.  I found Da Vinci's journal by the side of the road. Its pages hold so much love for his wife and sons. I will find a quiet spot, dig a grave, and lay the valiant couple to rest away from the crows and rats.;
;
May they find peace and joy in the afterlife and may they hold hands for eternity.;
<img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Leah-and-Da-Vinci.png' height='471' width='296'>;
;
Inigo is the one;
;
I am certain Inigo is the champion I have dreamed of. I returned to Riverhold and passed on the news about Lea and Da Vinci. The townsfolk were both saddened and shocked. They have no idea where Fergus and Inigo are, but word has been sent through what conduits exist in the hope they will be found. Since returning here and telling the tale of how I discovered and buried their parents, the locals have been more forthcoming with tales of Inigo's past. It seems he and his brother became heroes here in their teens. The town was overrun by a swarm of migrating giant spiders and three people died. When everyone else cowered in their homes, the boys and their parents ended the rather nasty insect infestation with ease. Da Vinci's journal backs this up. People say that it was Inigo that led the charge and that he killed 15 of the beasts by himself, laughing all the while! I can't wait to meet him. All I know is that he and Fergus were headed to Cyrodiil.  Maybe I'll strike out in that direction and try my luck.;

Inigo and Blowaft;
;
"I just stopped in a little village on the boarder and it seems that the brothers came through this way a few years ago. Inigo and Fergus are making a name for themselves. It seems that for quite some time the village had been terrorized by a giant known by the locals as Blowaft the Flatulent (for reasons you can imagine). Inigo and Fergus heard about this while renting a room for the night. Apparently a patron heard them talking. Inigo said ""I've never seen a giant before."" Then Fergus replied ""We'll deal with it tomorrow. It's late."" Inigo said ""Go get your beauty rest then. I'll take care of the giant."" Fergus nodded and said, ""Fair enough. Yell if you need me."" Then Inigo patted his brother on the shoulder and walked out. Fergus downed his ale and went to bed. An hour or so passed then Inigo staggered in dragging something heavy. He was grinning ear to ear. ""I've brought you a souvenir, barkeep."" He heaved the giant's club onto the bar. Everyone gasped. ""He's only slightly less smelly dead, so I'd bury him first thing in the morning if I were you."" said Inigo. Everyone cheered and laughed and the inn keeper mounted the club above the bar. After a lot of negotiation I managed to convince him to sell me the club. It's wonderful to have something he touched. It makes me feel closer to him somehow. He killed his first giant single handed! Inigo and Fergus are obviously as tough as they come!";
;
<img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Inigo-vs-Blowaft.png' height='471' width='296'>;
;
Inigo and the Witches of Glamoor;
;
"I followed a lead to the town of Anvil where I have discovered more evidence of the brothers and their daring deeds. Apparently they passed through here a year ago and ended the lives of a group of treacherous hags that had been seducing the local men, then sacrificing them. Inigo and Fergus rescued a man from the witches table and he was quite happy to tell me his tale. He said that 2 Khajiit men, one broad and golden, the other wiry and bluish purple, snuck into the cave where he was being held. The hags were in a hide tent at the far end of the cave, noisily preparing a beastly incantation of some sort. The golden Khajiit, Fergus I assume, crept to the far end of the tent sword in hand. Inigo readied his bow and waited in the shadows. Fergus raised a hand to Inigo, Inigo nodded then loosed an arrow. It tore a hole in the tent and there was a horrible scream from within. A witch ran out wielding a dagger, Fergus decapitated her and called out, ""Join us, ladies! You have 2 new suitors here! We are ready to take you out!"" There was a lot of angry yelling from within the tent then the witches burst out, spewing fire and ice from their hands. The poor man strapped to a sacrificial table watched in terror as a mighty battle began. He saw Fergus take the heads off 2 more witches then raise his shield as a massive gout of flame erupted from the hands of a 3rd. Inigo put an arrow through the hag's eye as his brother's shield disintegrated. Fergus tossed the melting hunk of metal away and ducked as Inigo shot a witch behind him. Apparently the brothers fought as if they had one mind. The man said it was like watching a beautiful dance... but with more screaming and blood. Soon the Witches of Glamoor all lay dead. The brothers laughed and hugged.";
<img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Inigo-vs-Witches.png' height='471' width='296'>;
They freed the man, looted the cave, and went on their way. After hearing this story I ventured to the cave where it all took place and found the remains of the witches. I took their heads. Yet more evidence that Inigo is indeed real, and the champion I seek.;

;
Inigo and Browulf the Broad;
;
I'm so close! I just received another Inigo artefact for my growing collection. The helm of a barbarian called Browulf the Broad. My continued search for Inigo and Fergus has led me north to a small unmarked settlement in the mountains that boarder Skyrim. The brothers were here 2 months ago! This Browulf character had been in charge for a year. He was fierce and mighty and utterly insane. He and his crew enslaved the locals and forced them to dig a mine. He was convinced that the village lay on an ebony deposit. He had the men and women serve him in a thousand horrid ways when they were not digging. They say that one day a local boy tripped while bringing Browulf a cup of mead. The brute reached out his slab-like arms and ripped the poor boy's head from his shoulders!;
;
"One day 2 Khajiit warriors came to town. They were greeted by one of Browulf's men at the gate. On seeing Inigo's unusual colouring the thug laughed, jeered, and pointed. Fergus drew his sword in a blur and amputated the man's leg in a flash. ""Next time you mock my brother I'll remove your head. Do we have an understanding?"" said Fergus. The man nodded, wept, and whimpered as the remains of his leg spurted blood onto the snow. Inigo stepped forward into the village, ""We have heard tales of the great misery you bullies have inflicted on the rightful owners of this land."" he shouted. ""Run and live or stand and die."" A group of Browulf's men drew their swords but did not advance. They obviously liked their legs. Browulf heard the commotion and stepped out of his hut. He was tall and possessed the bulky breadth of a giant. His legs and arms were like tree trunks, his chest was like a brewery barrel, and his head was the size of a cooking pot. ""What's all this? Everyone get back to work!"" he yelled. The locals all dropped their heads and hurried away. Fergus spoke up, ""I am guessing you are the reason the people here scurry like mice?"" Browulf laughed. ""Yes, and you had better scurry back the way you came, little kitty, unless you want to work my mine with the rest!"" Inigo drew his bow and addressed the retreating townsfolk. ""Worry not, good people. This smelly pile of dung is about to give his last order!"" Browulf's face turned red with rage. ""Kill them!"" he shouted. Fergus readied his sword and yelled, ""If you have no affiliation with this brute get indoors! We have no quarrel with you!"" People ran and doors slammed. Frightened faces peered through windows. Browulf's men advanced. There were at least 20, but after Inigo and Fergus made short work of the first 10, the rest fled. Browulf was furious and rushed at the brothers, wielding a massive axe. Fergus rolled out of the way and Inigo put an arrow into the huge man's helm. This normally would have ended things but Browulf was as solid as a rock and he kept coming. Fergus slashed at the huge man's arms and legs but no wound went deep, there was just too much bone and muscle in the way. Inigo advanced, aiming for the eyes, but the barbarian kept his head down as he fought Fergus and he only succeeded in peppering Browulf's helm with arrows. A massive hand shot out and took Fergus by the throat. It lifted him off the ground and squeezed. Inigo dropped his bow, drew his sword, and ran to his brother's aid. With flagging strength Fergus drove his blade into the crook of Browulf's neck. Inigo ducked a flailing axe blow, jumped on the brute's back, and stabbed his sword under Browulf's jaw. Suddenly Fergus was free. Browulf dropped his axe and fell to one knee. His gigantic hands groped for the two blades that now pierced his neck. Fergus rushed forward again and grabbed the <img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Inigo-vs-Browulf.png' height='471' width='296'> hilt of his sword. In perfect unison Inigo and Fergus withdrew their swords and swung them in opposite arcs. The blades rose, winked briefly in the sunlight, then hurtled down again. They collided at the point where Browulf's massive head met his massive neck, cleaving the 2 asunder. The brothers fell back into the snow, panting and laughing. The villagers rejoiced. They were finally free from tyranny. Inigo and Fergus set off south some time later.  I have Browulf's helm beside me as I write this. It cost a pretty penny but it was worth it. I'll continue my travels tomorrow. It looks like I'm going south.";

I am a murderer;

"I met a farmer on the road to Skingrad yesterday. When I asked if he had seen a couple of warrior Khajiits recently he laughed and said ""We took care of those thieving cutthroats a few days ago."" Shocked, I asked him to explain. He said that 2 Khajiit men had been stealing from the local farms and villages for weeks. After finding their camp, the farmer and a group of his mates crept up and attacked the thieves in their sleep using muffle scrolls they bought in town. He said they killed one, but the other got away. ""Doubt he'll be showing his face around here again though."" I explained that the Khajiit men I was looking for were not thieves. He said, ""All Khajiit are thieves!"" Distressed, I asked the farmer to show me the camp. I found Fergus, dead and gore-streaked, under a collapsed and torn tent. I knew it was him instantly. He looked vital, dynamic, and regal, despite the dried blood clinging to his golden fur. I have never felt such outrage, pain, and sadness. The farmer clearly saw a change come over me and stepped back. ""You fool!"" I shouted. ""This man was a hero, both noble and brave! He was no thief! By the gods, what have you done?""";
"The farmer took a step back. ""He was a filthy Khajiit, nothing more."" I felt my sadness turn to anger. Tears blurred my vision as I glared at the fool. He took another step back. ""He was a scoundrel, and a thief. Good for nothing. No use getting upset."" Before I knew what I was doing, my hands had taken charge and engulfed the farmer in a torrent of fire. I watched him burn and scream as flame leapt from my palms. I have never before now used my magic against a person. I still feel sick but Fergus deserved better than to die at the hands of a group of witless, racist inbreds! I would have immolated every last one of them if they had been standing there before me at that moment. <img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Fergus-Dead.png' height='471' width='296'>I cleared the ragged remains of the tent away and knelt by Fergus. I held his cold, golden hand. ""You saved Inigo didn't you?"" I whispered. ""Where did he go, Fergus?"" I dug a grave near by and laid the brave warrior to rest. I looked around for his sword but it was gone. Probably taken by one of his killers. There was no sign of Inigo anywhere. At least he survived the attack. I only hope his grief has not led him astray. I must find him soon. I will stay at the camp tonight and see if I'm visited by a new vision. Oh, Inigo. You are not as alone as you feel.";

Nothing;
;
It has been years since I found Fergus and I am no closer to locating Inigo. It is as if he dropped off the map. My visions of the Doom Strider are less frequent so perhaps the death of Fergus somehow changed our destiny. I know not. I have settled back in Skyrim for now. I have paid a small group of adventurers to seek out and acquire any artefacts and information relating to Inigo. So far none have returned. I have also employed the services of a powerful conjuration mage. He is hard at work in the Imperial City trying to create a summon spell that will hopefully teleport Inigo straight to me when cast. The mage assures me such a spell is possible but will only work if the caster is a true friend of the summoned individual. I told him that I am the only true friend Inigo has left. Unfortunatly the incantation will take some time to prepare.;

A Nightmare;
;
I had a horrific dream last night. Inigo was trapped in a vast, dark chamber. He was bleeding badly and surrounded by draugr. He fought them off and fled up a spiral staircase, but there was someone else there (a wizard?) who wasn't quite as lucky. Where did the dream take place? It looked like Skyrim but I can't be sure. Damn it! I need that spell!;
;
Hope;
;
Thank the gods! Inigo is indeed still alive! In my latest dream I saw him leaving Windhelm carrying a dragonfly in a jar. He looked tired and ragged but he's out there somewhere. With age his fur has began to take on rather a mauve hue. Time changes us all I suppose. When I started this book I had a thick head of black hair. I saw Inigo save a farmer from a frost troll! The farmer thanked him and offered him gold, but Inigo ignored the gesture and plodded away. Where is he heading? My vision ended shortly after he reached a fork in the road. Did he travel towards Riften or Whiterun? I'd set out in search of him immediately if the summon spell wasn't due any day now. Blast!;
<img src='img://Textures/clutter/books/images/Inigo-Summon.png' height='471' width='296'>;
;
Swindler!;
;
The spell arrived today and it is worthless! I have tried reading the tome a hundred times and it does nothing! Well not quite nothing. It vibrates gently then slams shut! That conjuration mage is a swindling con artist and I want my money back! I will keep trying none the less. Perhaps I can force it to work somehow. By the gods that charlatan is going to pay! I may not know much about conjuration but I can kick a fellow in the crotch as well as the next man!;

Inigo the Brave;
A tale suitable for any gender and race at any time.;

[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>1</p>;
"<p align='left'>One day Inigo was walking through his spider farm minding his own business when he smelt something was wrong. His nose was the best in the land so he followed it to a nearby cave where he found a beautiful woman of unspecified race crying. ""What's wrong?"" Said Inigo. ""A smelly Troll stole my sister,""</p>";
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>2</p>;
"<p align='left'> said the radiant woman. ""Can you help me? Please bring her back."" Inigo looked into the dark cave then into the eyes of the woman. ""If she's alive I will save your sister,"" he said. ""Thank you!"" Wept the woman. She kissed him and he entered the cave bow in hand. He could smell ugly troll everywhere.</p>";
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>3</p>;
<p align='left'> He soon came to a fork in the tunnel. A little stream ran to the left and a patch of glowing moss illuminated the way to the right.;
;
Follow the stream.  (15);
Go down the mossy tunnel. (5) </p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>4</p>;
"<p align='left'>Even in the darkness Inigo was a great archer and shortly after he loosed an arrow he heard a yowl of pain. It was a woman! Around him trolls advanced out of the dimness. The wounded woman shouted ""Kill the handsome cat!""";
Aim an arrow at the woman's voice. (18);
Attack the trolls. (19)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>5</p>;
<p align='left'>The mossy tunnel was almost as bright as Inigo and soon he saw movement up ahead. It was a smelly troll eating something.;
;
Run at the troll. (7);
Sneak by. (8);
Go back to the stream. (15)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>6</p>;
<p align='left'>Inigo bravely reached for the note but as his hand closed around it the man came alive! He was a zombie!;
;
Stab it with an arrow! (9);
Run away!  (10)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>7</p>;
<p align='left'>Inigo let out a barbaric yawp and ran at the troll! The troll looked up from his meal, wet himself, then ran away screaming like a little girl. It had been eating a local farmer by a slimy hole in the ground. The farmer was not anyone's sister so Inigo pressed on.;
Jump down the hole. (11);
Keep going straight. (21)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>8</p>;
<p align='left'>Inigo was very sneaky but as he got closer the troll smelt his delicious aroma and swiped at Inigo with an ugly claw.;
;
Duck! (13);
Stab it with an arrow! (14)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>9</p>;
"<p align='left'>Inigo bravely stabbed the zombie with an arrow and pierced its brain by way of its eye. It shuddered and died. Inigo read the note. ""I love you. Meet me in the cave at midnight"" said the note. It was a woman's writing. Inigo looked up and saw a troll close by!";
Run at the troll. (7);
Sneak by. (8)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>10</p>;
<p align='left'>Inigo unexpectedly took to his heals and ran. The zombie's dead hand clutched his ankle, tripping him. He fell and smashed in his head on a rock.;
;
THE END</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>11</p>;
<p align='left'>Inigo landed lightly and looked about. He was in an immense bad smelling chamber. The sound of messy eating surrounded him.;
;
Growl loudly in a terrifying manner. (16);
Fire an arrow into the darkness ahead. (4)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>12</p>;
"<p align='left'>""What's going on here?"" said Inigo. The woman replied, ""I needed to feed my pets. I'm sorry I know it was wrong."" She coughed wetly. ""I need you to tell my sister something... come closer.""";
;
Approach the woman. (20);
Put an arrow through her eye. (24)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>13</p>;
<p align='left'>Inigo used his legendary reflexes and dodged the troll. The stupid beast stumbled to the side and fell through a hole in the cave floor. Inigo heard its neck snap below. He chuckled to himself then looked about.;
;
Jump down the hole. (11);
Keep going straight. (21)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>14</p>;
<p align='left'>Inigo bravely reached for an arrow but he was too slow. The troll ripped his head clean off and Inigo never saved anyone again.;
;
THE END</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>15</p>;
<p align='left'>The stream was cold but Inigo was hardy and he liked the splashing noises his feet made. He soon found a dead man clutching a note.;
;
Read the note. (6);
Move on. (21);
Go back. Follow the mossy tunnel. (5)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>16</p>;
"<p align='left'>Inigo puffed up his chest and let out one of his famous growls. The eating stopped in a hurry and he saw many trolls run for a distant exit tunnel. A woman's voice echoed from the darkness ahead, ""Stop running! Kill that attractive cat!"" The trolls turned and faced Inigo. Aim an arrow at the woman's voice. (18) Kill the trolls! (19)</p>";
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>17</p>;
<p align='left'>Inigo's arrows hit the stalactites and they crashed to the cave floor below. He heard trolls being squashed and he smiled to himself. When all was quiet he jumped down among the smelly bodies and had a look about. He heard a woman weeping near by.;
Approach the woman. (20);
Call out to her. (12)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>18</p>;
<p align='left'>Inigo used his keen senses and aimed true. He heard the woman gasp then fall to the floor. The trolls lost their nerve and ran away. Inigo could hear that the woman was near death but still alive.;
;
Approach the woman. (20);
Call out to her. (12)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>19</p>;
<p align='left'>Even in low light conditions Inigo was the greatest archer in the land. He killed four trolls, five, ten, sixteen! His arms were a furious blur. More and more filthy trolls fell to his bow but after a hundred he began to tire. First he lost his strength, then all his arrows, then his life.;
         THE END</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>20</p>;
"<p align='left'>The woman was crumpled and bleeding. She smelt very ugly. ""My sister sent you didn't she?"" She gasped. ""Now die!"" The troll-hag suddenly slashed out at Inigo with a glass dagger!";
;
Grab her hand! (22);
Put an arrow through her eye! (24)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>21</p>;
<p align='left'>The tunnel grew darker and Inigo heard himself crunching over dry bones. He smelt blood on the air. Soon he was standing high above a dark cavern. He could hear ugly movement below and he saw sharp stalactites hanging from the cavern roof. Jump down. (11);
Fire a few arrows at the stalactites. (17)</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>22</p>;
<p align='left'>Inigo grabbed at the hag's hand but she was supernaturally fast and the dagger sliced poor Inigo's arm clean off! He stumbled back. He tried to draw his bow but he was a hand short and it fell uselessly to the ground...</p>;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>23</p>;
<p align='left'>...The woman fell on him stashing and stabbing. The last thing he heard was the troll-hag's manic laughter.</p>;
;
THE END;
[pagebreak];
<p align='right'>24</p>;
"<p align='left'>In a textbook example of skill and grace Inigo loosed an arrow into the woman's face! As she expired her body thrashed and began to change. It grew thick fur and hard skin. Soon her corpse looked half troll, half ugly woman. Inigo covered his nose against its stench and left the cave. ""Did you find my sister?"" Asked the pretty woman waiting outside. ""Yes. I had to kill her. I am sorry."" Said Inigo. ""Thank you!"" Said the woman. ""She was going to kill me if I didn't bring her more food for her trolls."" Inigo was very understanding and took her to his farm to recuperate. It turned out that the woman liked playing with spiders as much as Inigo. They were married a month later and lived happily ever after.";

Ready your weapon, my friend. There is killing to be done.;
I will send you off in style!;
When we die our bodies are so clearly empty.;
You may want to dispose of this before having guests round, my friend.;
I hate those giant, black, chittering insects you get here! They make my eyes hurt and my fur stand on end.;
"I like the simple things in life; sitting in a warm bar, the company of a beautiful woman, bashing a giant spider in the face.";
Taking the scenic route is my style. I'm all for risk and adventure but why throw yourself off a cliff for no reason?;
You can trust me to carry your gear. I am very strong, and discrete.;
My heart swells at the sight of natural beauty.;
I go on a bit don't I.;
I am (Cough) thinking I do not like Peryite very much.;
I am thinking that failing this test would have grave consequences.;
I think I may have killed a lot of chickens during our drunken night out. If you see any disgruntled farmers looking my way act casual.;
I am thinking what were we thinking... and what were we drinking?;
Despite inexplicably becoming a drunken mess at some point I still seem to have all my fur. At least there is that.;
I am thinking Langley did a wonderful job renovating this place for me. Wow.;
I am thinking it is wonderful to have my fleas back again. I will tell them to hold on tighter from now on.;
Eyes on the prize, my friend. Let us find that Elder Scroll. This is quite an adventure.;
The secret opening to Mother's home is somewhere nearby, but with her in a jar I fear it lost forever. It is probably a good thing to be honest.;
If I were a valuable horn I am not sure I would enjoy it here.;
I am wondering if the people here mind living below such noisy neighbours.;
I'm thinking my brain is in pain. I hope it does not end up completely lame. That would be a shame.;
I'm hoping we can put an end to these mind vibrations. They are quite hard to ignore.;
Blowaft's club still smells a little. He was the most odersome giant I have ever put an end to.;
That helmet up there was only a little harder than the head of its owner. Luckily the neck beneath it was quite soft.;
That figure surrounded by fire in the picture over there must be the Doom Strider. I do not like the look of those eyes.;
I feel very significant sitting here.;
Sell of this costume I am wearing if you want. Let's be honest I look better without it.;
I've got some giant scaly lizard parts you could shift if we need more gold.;
Maybe sell that skooma you gave me. I do not need it.;
Maybe sell that mammoth cheese. Its smell is off putting.;
Unless you are using that sabre cat's tooth as a backscratcher or something I'd consider trading it in.;
If you're not saving them for a special someone why don't you sell off those gems?;
At least the inn is still standing. Glad to see town planning has its priorities in order.;
Let's leave this fibber to his madness before it rubs off on us.;
Even though Fergus and I had our own beds at home, any night our mother was working at the orphanage, we would stay over.;
We would often wait until she dozed off and lead the other children on daring midnight snack expeditions.;
"Our mother made Fergus and I wear strips of cloth with ""Already taken"" embroidered on them any time we were visiting her at work.";
Sometimes if a child saw a potential parent they did not like the look of, I would lend them my strip of cloth.;
Achhhh!;
That is the tallest woman I have seen today up there. I wonder if she likes shorter men.;
I'm thinking the stars look amazing tonight.;
It is quite a sight this place, but would I live here? No.;
You would not believe the dream I am having at the moment. I cannot wait to wake up and tell you all about it.;
A horrible infestation snuffed out whatever light this house once had.;
Someone really likes crabs. Get a life! Where's the Spider Slayer's Shanty mmm?;
Crazy jester makes me want to wash my brain.;
I am thinking we are ill but we will get better.;
I am thinking I am ill but I will get better.;
I am thinking this land has some of the best rain in the world.;
I am wondering what giants think about us. We must seem very small and irritating to them.;
"Lydia looks happy here. The first thought to go through her mind today and it is ""Shopping!""";
Lydia really likes that chair doesn't she? I hear she's a bit of a lazy moron.;
Why mess with perfection?;
I am remembering our trip to Crongvangr cave. Now THAT was an adventure. So many silly spiders to squash. It was fantastic.;
We seem to be a bit low on funds. Why don't we get out there and sell some stuff or take a second job until this adventuring thing pans out?;
You have a bit of gold I see. Well, plenty more where that came from. Eyes on the prize, my friend. Let's see if we can't fill that purse of yours.;
You are very wealthy. You don't need to be adventuring. You could be riding through your sweetroll room on the back of a golden spider right now.;
I don't need that token to read your future. You will meet an old woman who speaks in vague sentences. That'll be fifty gold please.;
Mr Dragonfly is happy we visited the place where he made his daring drop. He says thank you for helping him confront his past.;
We are being very sneaky.;
It smells like Oblivion here... slightly charred and inarticulate.;
Oh no. The pretty archery goddess has had some kind strange accident. What happened? I must have blacked out. This is a tragedy.;
If there's trouble down here it won't hear us coming.;
I'm wondering how long we will be crouched like this. It is not good for the knees.;
If a dead hand grabbed my tail right now I think I'd scream.;
I'm wondering if machines have ears to hear us with. I will be quiet just in case.;
I'm hoping you get a good deal in here.;
I'm thinking if you don't eat that sweetroll I will.;
I'm thinking you are a natural with that bow.;
I'm wondering how many lockpicks you have broken in your time.;
I'm thinking you are very good at making things.;
I'm thinking you are deadly with that weapon.;
I'm wondering if we should leave.;
I'm thinking the shopkeeper is wondering what we are up to.;
I'm thinking I can't see very well with this on my head.;
Why the hat, my friend? Is it an image thing or are you going to cook us something? I would enjoy some fancy food.;
If you think this hat will turn me into a master chef I am sorry to disappoint you. You'd be better off eating the hat than anything I cook.;
I'm thinking I like these clothes very much.;
I am not qualified to wear these robes. Maybe you should hang on to them.;
These robes smell like repulsive magic, reanimation... and vacant graves.;
These robes are a lovely colour. I look like a dim furry patch of fallen sky right now.;
These robes are as dark as death's eye. They make me feel threatening.;
I'm thinking I was born naked so why worry about it now.;
I'm thinking all this adventuring has given you a very nice body.;
These clothes do not reflect my lack of political affiliation.;
I feel pretty special dressed in these robes. Kneel before your new Emperor! I'm joking. Do not assassinate me please.;
Don't I need to pass a test or have a license or something to wear this pretty armour?;
We must destroy this hat! It has a tongue that jabbers in my skull!;
This hat says... let's kill someone!;
I'm hoping you'll lend me that ebony armour some time.;
I know these clothes came from a god but they still smell like poop.  God poop maybe, but still poop.;
I'm thinking this guard's armour is not too bad.;
I'm wondering why you want me to cover my face.;
I'm wondering why you are dressed like a guard.;
I'm thinking I am safe in this armour.;
I'm thinking you look menacing.;
I'm thinking I look pretty sharp at the moment.;
I'm thinking these clothes do not suit me.;
You can tell this armour was forged by the blind.;
I'm thinking how scary I must look dressed like this.;
Shouldn't we be saving everyone from Alduin or something? That world-eater is not going to kill him self you know.;
I'm thinking you are wearing an Amulet of Mara, and that while you are quite a catch, I am not interested. It would ruin our friendship.;
I'm wondering how well you can see with your face covered like that.;
I'm wondering why you are covering your face. You are not ugly, my friend.;
I'm wondering if mermaids are real. If they are, I am wondering if they like hairy men.;
I'm thinking you have picked a funny time to relax.;
I'm asking myself why you are sitting around when we should be on our way.;
I'm thinking you look too comfortable.;
I'm remembering the first time I got drunk. I awoke the next day with a shaved tail and an ear full of goat cheese. It was quite a night.;
My father always said alcohol is not the answer but it does make you forget the question.;
I'm thinking that it is colder outside than it is in here.;
I'm thinking maybe we should get a seat.;
If you want to have a chat maybe we should take a seat. My tongue wags more when I am not using my legs.;
With all that wine you are carrying you could set up your own bar.;
The summon Inigo spell has more than a few uses. With it I can surprise enemies, get out of trouble in a hurry, and really weird people out.;
I'm wondering if Langley is dreaming right now. If so I am hoping he gets some news about the Doom Strider soon.;
I'm thinking about what Langley said to you outside his house. Your brain is not stupid, my friend. It just does not like being pushed about.;
Accepting Langley's apology was very big of you. You showed great restraint.;
I'm thinking I would like my bow back.;
I'm thinking my bow suits you. It is yours for as long as you need it.;
You are very political! I guess the Stormcloaks have a point or two. I just wish their leader wasn't such a pigheaded bore.;
Well, this land is safe from the Imperials. I wonder how long peace will last though. Our new leader likes fighting even more than freedom I fear.;
You are very political! For all their faults the Imperials bring a certain unity to the land. I just hope you don't lose yourself in the ranks.;
The Stormcloaks never had a chance. A shame so many people had to die for what they believed. At least we at last live in a time of peace... for now.;
I wonder if Alduin will ever return. If he does I will help you destroy him. I'll also be sure to remind you to take his smelly head next time.;
I am so proud that we ended Alduin together. I almost wish he would return so we could do it again. We were pretty amazing.;
Our trip to the Thalmor Embassy was depressing. It is a shame that so-called high society is often morally backward and intolerant;
I was remembering our battle with Alduin at the Throat of the World. I admit I wondered if we were going to survive at the time.;
Thank the gods for Dragonrend, and our skill of course.;
I will never forget fighting that dragon outside Whiterun. It was exhilarating and terrifying in equal measure.;
When you absorbed its soul I think my throat and bowels briefly exchanged places. I am still recovering.;
When you summoned me to your side after flying away from Dragonsreach on that beast I was relieved you had made the trip without being eaten.;
I will always remember standing next to you in that strange place knowing we were about to make history. A good memory.;
So what if that daedra's dog could talk. I can walk on two legs, fire a bow, and talk. Do I get a treat?;
Meridia is my kind of daedra. She hates the undead almost as much as me. I'm glad you helped her. Dawnbreaker was well worth the trouble.;
You met Sheogorath and he did not turn you into a block of cheese. Congratulations!;
You went to all that trouble to become a chef only to kill the Emperor's double? Being a double is a risky business.;
So, Farkas is werewolf. He may be a bit smelly but he is a good shield-brother. Together you destroyed many undead. I am proud of you.;
I am thinking about your Proving with Farkas. I will never forget seeing him transform when he was surrounded by those Silverhand thugs.;
They did not stand a chance. That was quite an adventure. A little too many undead for my tastes, but all in all I am glad I was there.;
A lot of my past is shameful, but I do not regret killing those Silverhand scoundrels one bit. They were very ugly minded.;
I am remembering our witch hunting expedition. Once upon a time my brother and I were tested against similar foes.;
It may sound strange but that adventure brought back good memories.;
I still think about Kodlak every now and then. I am glad we released his soul. He was a good man.;
I think Meridia owes me a special sword too. I did help you help her after all. Ah well.;
That horrible lighthouse we explored still haunts my thoughts every now and then.;
I am glad we made it out of there, my friend. I was not sure we would.;
A bunch of magic anomalies attack Winterhold and who saves the day? You do. You probably prevented another Great Collapse. You are a hero!;
That meadery in Whiterun had a major pest problem. The evil wizard in the basement wasn't helping matters either. You should have been paid extra.;
That dragon you trapped must feel pretty ashamed. I bet all the other smelly gas bags are talking behind his back now.;
You are officially a bard now. Sing me a song. Dance for me. Tell me a tale. No? Your material must be very good if it is so secret.;
Never trust a fanatic, my friend. Mehrunes' Razor is in safer hands with you. Maybe not safer hands, more... capable hands. Don't cut yourself.;
"No matter how hungry I am I have never thought to myself, ""Look. There is a tasty dead person."" You are not a fussy eater.";
Winterhold College must be hard to run when you're always out saving the land in other ways. I'd let J'zargo handle it. How much damage could he do?;
I'm thinking how happy I am you have given me another chance. I will not waste it.;
I often create my own songs but they are very bad. I just don't have the time to work at being gifted.;
I have a few basic ideas for songs about you. They are just works in progress though. They sound unmusical.;
If you sit down and I sing be ready to laugh... but not too hard OK?;
There are many talented people here. I could learn a lot from them if I could be bothered.;
This place smells fancy and fanatical.;
Mercer is rude and he smells fishy.;
Watch your back, my friend. I do not trust this Mercer guy.;
Are you sure it is Ok that I am here?;
These people are shady. I must admit I feel quite at home.;
You have more that a few skeletons in your closet.;
If these walls had a voice I think they would scream and scream and scream.;
I don't know if I could ever relax here.;
Everyone says Bretons are fantastic with magic. Maybe a little of your talent will rub off on me. I hope there are no uncomfortable side affects.;
Your ancestry is interesting. In a certain light you look quite Elven, then I blink and you almost look like a Nord.;
Maybe that is why you are twice as good looking as almost everyone else.;
Look at us, an Altmer and a Khajiit putting the world right together. People here will think it is an illusion. I call it setting a good example.;
You are tall and slender. I am muscular and hairy. We both have fantastic ears though.;
You Altmer are wonderful mages, yes? Maybe you can enchant my fleas. They are resistant to damage but they lack any real battle prowess.;
Some people say your kind are snooty. You do not seem snooty to me. It is not your fault you are better than those opinionated fools.;
Look at us, a Bosmer and a Khajiit taming the world together. We are the stuff of legend, my friend.;
Your kind can talk to animals, yes? Could you have a word with my fleas please? I have asked them to take a day off but they do not listen to me.;
I have much in common with the Bosmer. I am a tree loving, bow twanging, disease resistant, sneak machine. We are very similar.;
Look at us, an Imperial and a Khajiit bringing order to the land side by side. We are a credit to civilization.;
I am better at inflicting damage than restoration. It is a good thing you Imperials are talented at healing. Accidents can happen.;
You are naturally diplomatic, my Imperial friend. Maybe you could have a word with my fleas. They are quite excitable. They need to calm down.;
Look at us, a Redguard and a Khajiit fighting together to make the world a safer place. We make heroism stylish, my friend.;
You Redguards are fantastic warriors. I feel pity and a little embarrassment for those who oppose us. They do not stand a chance.;
Sometimes I can almost smell the adrenaline rushing through your veins. I am proud and relieved you are on my side.;
You are lucky my Argonian friend. It must be nice not having any hair to comb or fleas to look after.;
You lady lizards are quite beautiful in your own way. Do you lay eggs? I have always wondered.;
I wish I could breathe under water like you. I'd chase my tail at the bottom of sea for hours. I bet the fish wouldn't laugh at me.;
Look at us, two Khajiit far from home making the world a safer place. This land is lucky to have us, my friend.;
Do you ever chase your tail? You can tell me, it will go no further. We cats all have a kitten inside I think.;
I don't moult much here in Skyrim. Do you? I used to lose much hair but here I seem to need it more.;
If you ever want a few of my fleas just let me know.;
I hear your kind has quite the temper. I'm surprised you haven't tried to kill me yet. That is not a suggestion by the way.;
Your people get a bad reputation. I haven't seen you bite the head off one goat yet. So much for reputations.;
You've been as busy as a bee. It must be exciting being the top thief in the business.;
I have much in common with Orcs. I respect honour, I enjoy a scrap, and I like strong women.;
I'm glad you do not hold the racist views shared by many of your kind. We are setting a good example.;
You Nords are enthusiastic warriors. Mind you do not injure me while we are fighting together. Accidental murder is hard to live with.;
I do not know how you Nords stay warm with so little fur. Maybe it is a thirst for battle that boils your blood.;
You Dark Elves are good with magic, yes? You handle the fancy stuff and I'll stick to stabbing people with pointy things.;
Your skin is a delightful shade, my friend. Don't let anyone tell you any different.;
Look at us, a Dunmer and a Khajiit setting the world right together. We make valour look good.;
You are lucky my Dunmer friend. I wish I was flame retardant. My brother called me retardant but I'm not sure what he meant. I'm quite flammable.;
You lead the Companions now, yes? Maybe you could make bathing mandatory. Whiterun smells like sweaty dogs to me.;
Do you ever get the feeling we are all part of some elaborate diversion made for some idiot's amusement? I don't.;
I see they have not replaced Susanna yet. Her beauty was brighter than any candle.;
I hope killing all those guardian beasts was the right thing to do. Nature is everywhere. I would not anger it more than is necessary.;
If Boethiah ever asks you to sacrifice someone again please remember I do not enjoy being possessed or dead.;
If a dead lady told me to go kill people I'm not sure I'd trust my mind ever again. You can't hear her at the moment can you?;
When I see Mjoll all the blood leaves my head if you know what I mean. She is impressive.;
I have no Idea why Mjoll likes that little cretin so much. He looks like a scrawny, ugly liar to me.;
I never met anyone who got drunk with a Daedric prince before. A dangerous business. I hope he did not make you pay for the alcohol.;
I cannot believe we got drunk with a daedric prince! He gave us a night to remember, sure, but would I worship him? No. My liver could not take it.;
You are a lover and a fighter. An agent of Mara and an assassin. If I ever need to marry the wrong woman then have her killed I know who to come to.;
You left quite an impression at the Thalmor embassy. You are a party pooper, in a good way.;
You are lucky to have met Nocturnal. I hear she is very pretty and wears very distracting robes.;
Whiterun owes you a debt, I think. That lovely, big, nice smelling tree almost completely masks the local canine odour now that it's healthy again.;
Long ago I also escaped Cidhna Mine. I disguised myself as a rock and rolled out of there an inch at a time.;
I'm thinking of the time I fell off a barstool while chasing my tail. Embarrassing.;
I'm wondering if this place has a toilet. I guess not.;
I'm thinking the folk here are not used to seeing naked people in their bar.;
I'm thinking our nakedness is drawing attention.;
I'm wondering if you should put some clothes on before we get thrown out.;
Two dragons walk into an inn. One says to the other, it is hot in here! The other says, shut your mouth!;
I'm feeling a little underdressed but I do not mind.;
I'm wondering if my dragonfly misses me when I am gone.;
This is a nasty place. Smells like blood and fear.;
I'm wondering what you did here. Don't tell me I don't want to know.;
I'm wondering if dragons can get drunk. A drunken dragon may be easier to kill.;
I'm thinking that farms smell green and brown.;
This torch is doing battle with the rain. I hope the torch wins.;
If I burn myself with this torch I will try to muffle my screams of agony.;
If you think I'm drawing attention with this torch you had better look after it. I can not resist lighting it.;
I'm enjoying sneaking underground. It feels dangerous.;
We may be quiet but we are putting on quite a light show you and I.;
I'm hoping I do not accidentally discover a combustible gas pocked down here. I think a giant flaming ball of gas would draw attention.;
Why are here? I already got scars in a place like this. I do not wish to earn any more.;
What do the dead do when they are not attacking us? I doubt they sing and dance. Maybe they practice their groaning.;
It is good you have that sword, my friend. It was created to deal with places like this.;
If any dead attack us, I will try to set them on fire. You kill them while they are distracted, OK?;
If you should die down here do not worry I will drag your body out. We wouldn't want you roaming around here for eternity.;
Why do the dead have glowing eyes? The lights may be on but no one is at home.;
Most undead are immune to poison. That lovely spider venom you have would be wasted on any we meet.;
Maybe we can distract any lively dead people we find by throwing them a sweetroll. Everyone likes sweetrolls.;
Butterflies, sweetrolls, the sun, the moons, the dark... the dead.;
This is bringing back bad memories for me. My scars itch in places like this.;
Can you hear shuffling? Oh Gods, I hate these places!;
Watch out I saw something move behind you! No. It was my imagination. I am sorry.;
What if my fleas die here? Will I have a bunch of zombie parasites living on me? Oh Gods.;
Doesn't this place scare you at all? You are braver than me, my friend. Don't tell anyone I said that please.;
Where did the ancient Nords bury their children? Why did I say that? If a little dead girl appeared I'd probably perform an evasive suicide.;
I'm trying to stay calm, collected, and focused. It is made harder by my current need to urinate.;
Right now my bravery is as dead as the things that walk here.;
Being naked is usually fine but I'd appreciate another layer of protection down here.;
You have fire? Good. The dead are extremely flammable.;
The dead are scary but as stupid as a bag of callipers.;
These places are almost as interesting as me.;
These places are devious. Let us be mindful of our surroundings.;
Whoever constructed all this had security on the brain.;
We are having an adventure, yes? Metal and steam only make our journey more exciting.;
You know, I almost like the looks of this place. Dangerous and beautiful.;
The first time I came in to a place like this I could hardly walk out I was carrying so much loot.;
I am dressed like I belong here.;
You look like a part of this place in that armour. I doubt the machines will leave you alone though.;
"It must be boring being a machine; doing the same job every day in the same building. We are lucky we lead such interesting lives.";
Metal men are funny things. I wonder if I could tame one. It could bring me drinks,and scratch behind my ears,and would no doubt kill me in my sleep.;
I'm wondering if machines think about anything. If we find one with ears and a voice I will ask it.;
The smell of oil is strong here.;
Do not waste poison or frost magic on any automatons we find here. They are immune.;
Remember to loot any Dwarven Centurions we encounter. They often carry very good quality arrows.;
Dwarven spiders are really not very spider like. The sounds they make when I hit them are uninteresting.;
Falmer are good with magic. Be careful.;
I'm hoping something nasty doesn't crawl out of the wall and make me jump.;
The things here like water but they do not bathe.;
I hate to think what would happen if we got stuck down here. If that happens you can eat me to survive. I probably taste better than insect.;
Be careful of the bug men. They are blind but they hear everything.;
Apparently the bug men that live in places like this used to be beautiful. Talk about letting yourself go.;
I'm thinking I can smell horrible, chittering insects. I hope they are dead already.;
This ground is sticky in places.;
I expected a lot more darkness here. We must be as quiet as shadows.;
They say the Falmer were once a proud and prosperous race before they were driven underground. They are pitiful creatures.;
Something smells ugly here. It is not me.;
It is a good idea to sneak. The things here have keen senses.;
If I see something nasty I will try to kill it before it gets to you.;
I'm hoping I do not set myself on fire with this torch. It has happened before.;
I hope this light doesn't attract any passing dragons.;
I'm hoping you are not going to turn me in to a chicken with that staff of yours.;
I'm hoping you don't aim that ugly staff at me.;
I'm hoping you do not shout and sink this boat.;
I'm wondering when I will be getting my sea legs.;
I'm wondering if anyone has ever tried to farm spiders.;
I'm thinking it would be nice to own a farm. Inigo the farmer doesn't quite sound right though.;
I'm wondering if I could ever grow an impressive beard.;
I'm thinking this place smells grey.;
I'm wondering what giants think about. Rocks? Mammoths? Large women?;
I'm wondering what all these marks on the rocks mean. Maybe they're telling us we are welcome to come in and eat some mammoth.;
Giants are almost as hairless as you my scaly friend. I wonder if their beard-fleas are bigger than my body-fleas.;
Dragons smell better when they are not trying to eat me.;
Maybe there's a dragon egg around here somewhere. Dragons lay eggs, right? Or am I thinking of goats?;
Not just anyone can kill a dragon.You should be proud.Maybe try to keep that absorbing their souls thing under your hat though.It freaks people out.;
I can't believe I am standing here in the home of a dragon. My boyhood fantasies have come true.;
I don't know if it is the best idea to be walking around a dragon's lair carrying bits of dead dragon. You may attract trouble. The big scaly kind.;
If the gods are upset at my nakedness they should avert their godly eyes, or take more pride in their work.;
Who made the gods I wonder? No one ever told me a satisfactory answer.;
I'm praying that we become very rich. I hope others are not praying for the same thing. There is only so much gold to go around.;
I'm using this time on my knees to ask the gods for help standing up again. I think I need new joints in my legs.;
I'm hoping the dead here, stay dead.;
I'm wondering if I will have a nice grave when I die. Maybe I'll mysteriously vanish off a cliff or something and my body will never be found.;
We could probably fix this boat up if we had the time, inclination, and skill.;
This ship was not designed to travel across the land.;
What should we do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?;
You Orcs are strong yes? Do you think you could rip a giant's toe off if need be?;
I'm wondering how you are still afloat with all that stuff you are carrying.;
I'm wondering if the water is safe.;
I'm thinking you are a strong swimmer.;
I'm asking myself why you are calmly bobbing there while there is a giant monster surfacing behind you! I am joking there is no giant monster.;
I'm thinking you are a good friend.;
I hope this place is stable.;
If I am buried here under a big pile of dirt and rock, dig me out please.;
I'm wondering why we have stopped.;
I'm thinking I like this place.;
I'm thinking it is quite cold here.;
I'm thinking this snow is pretty.;
I'm thinking the rain makes my fur smell good.;
I'm thinking I am soggy but I do not mind.;
I'm wondering how many raindrops have hit us since we started talking.;
I'm wondering if you like this snow as much as I do.;
My nose likes this place even more than I do.;
The Rift smells arboreal. I love it.;
"The Rift smells even better in the rain; like wet leaves and small woodland animals.";
Riften market is not as well equipped as the surrounding shops but I do like the hustle and the bustle.;
The market is closed but there is still stock to be had if we are quiet and quick.;
Helga is not very nice but I find myself attracted to her none the less. She smells saucy.;
This is a lovely home you have here! The build is good quality and it smells woody.;
Watch you keep the fire low. It would be a shame if all this went up in smoke.;
This would be a nice place to rule from. It has character and warmth, just like me.;
The Bee and Barb always smells scaly to me, in a good way.;
I've never tried winking at a skeever before. I usually just slay them on sight and save the subtle body language for the ladies.;
Sure this place looks lovely but I bet it is a nightmare to heat.;
Many people come here looking for aid. Must be hard being in charge. I'm glad I have you to tell me what to do.;
What an ugly building. I feel like I'm being told to shove off by the architecture.;
This place has a draft and my fleas say it smells like testosterone. Whatever that is.;
This is a very nice home. A little too large for my tastes but impressive all the same.;
You know you should rent some of this out. You'd make a lot of gold.;
"It reminds me a little of Cyrodiil here; a thin veneer of civility barely masking the dirty doings beneath. It is nice looking though.";
This place smells of coin and good taste.;
The ships here never seem to go anywhere. Maybe they are just showboats.;
The city sleeps but we do not. What are we up to, my friend?;
Whiterun has some of the best air in Skyrim. There is a subtle dog breath aftertaste though.;
This building makes me feel as snug as a flea in fur.;
The Bannered Mare is nicer than most of its patrons. A family feud divides this town.;
This is a roomy place! It makes me want to sing and dance and chase my tail. Do not worry I will control myself.;
I have rarely seen a place so full of fighting spirit.;
You are the only companion I need.;
There is dog hair everywhere!;
You are the top dog around here. Make sure you keep these pups on a tight leash.;
I'm thinking I smell wolves.;
Windhelm is miserable beyond measure. My fleas say they are near suicide.;
The cold usually doesn't bother me but here it cuts like an ugly knife.;
If we do not leave this place soon I will be forced to end my life in protest.;
Can you place an order for me? One comb, 2000 ebony arrows, and a noose to hang myself with. Let us leave now please.;
In such a cold environment it pays to keep the ceilings low to conserve heat. Maybe you should tell someone.;
Who rules from here? Some depressive, hater of light and joy? I'd rather sit in mammoth dung than a throne in this building.;
This is not a nice house. It reeks of pain and distress. I bet most homes in Windhelm are the same.;
If I lived here I'd be tempted to accidentally burn the place to the ground.;
This Inn is not too bad for Windhelm. At least in here I do not need to worry about being assaulted by inbred racists.;
This place smells of your kind. I think we are among friends here.;
Watch out. This place reeks of racism. Your kind is not popular here. Neither is mine.;
We seem to be in a reptile house. It smells like dry skin. At least it is warmer in here.;
Is this where you and your reptile friends hang out? It is quite pleasant. Warm too.;
It is like being at the bottom of an alien ocean.;
There is so much to see and smell here. My nose is very busy at the moment.;
This place reminds me of nothing. It is as strange as it is beautiful.;
Be careful we are in an environment unlike any other. Who knows what me may find.;
I think I can smell spiders somewhere close by.;
I'm trying to imagine this place in happier times. I guess most of what it was is at the bottom of the Sea of Ghosts now.;
Many lives were lost here. I wonder if we will ever know what really happened.;
It doesn't matter how long I spend here, I will never master magic of any kind.;
This is a beautiful building and not as cold as I thought it would be.;
You're the Arch-Mage now. If anyone here crosses you, turn them into a Troll's bottom. You do know the spell for that, don't you?;
You will make quite a name for yourself here. This place suits you.;
Look at you running your own magical institution. You have done your people proud... and probably put a few noses out of joint in the process.;
I've read most of these books already, I don't remember what they're about, but I've definitely read them.;
I'd be scared to sleep here with so many experiments going on. What if I woke as something unnatural?;
Markarth is sturdier than the minds of most of its people.;
It would not surprise me if one day Markarth's human population just disappeared, its residents wiped out by an army of grumpy machines.;
There is a constant war between manufactured geometry and the natural world in Markarth. Nature will win. She always does in the end.;
This is an angular inn. It is making me self-conscious about my curves.;
Living here would be a step down from homelessness. It smells ripe.;
It looks like a machine made this house and it smells a little oily.;
This place does have a certain charm. It is very orderly.;
Money, money, money. Health is better than wealth in my opinion.;
I can smell more ladies than I can see. The others are probably in the back gossiping together.;
This is where you ladies get together for a gossip, right? If you would rather I wait outside just let me know.;
I think I can hear whirring and clicking deep underground.;
I'm wondering why we are in such a dismal town.;
Who do I talk to about getting planning permission to build here?;
The Warrior Stone allows you to improve your combat skills more rapidly. Side effects may include amputation, blindness, and head loss.;
The Thief Stone let's you learn how to be a sneaky menace faster. Side effects may include a fear of loud noises and an unshakable feeling of guilt.;
With The Mage Stone you learn magic faster. Side effects may include spontaneous combustion, healed enemies, and infertility.;
The Apprentice Stone lets you recover magicka twice as fast. Side effects may include more magicka damage and violent jealousy from other mages.;
The Atronach Stone gives you 50 extra points of Magicka. Side effects include longer spell charge times and the urge to show off in public places.;
The Lady Stone improves both your recovery time and your physical prowess. Side effects include random sprinting and a fatal disregard for danger.;
The Lord Stone increases your ability to take damage. Side effects may include a lack of thought and terminal bravery.;
The Serpent Stone temporarily paralyzes an enemy and poisons them. Side effects may include regret and pain if you use it on me.;
The Shadow Stone lets you turn invisible once a day. Side effects may include loneliness and the feeling you are of no consequence.;
The Steed Stone makes you as strong as a horse. Side effects may include the accidental breakage of furniture and random clothing malfunctions.;
The Tower Stone lets you unlock almost any lock once a day. Side effects may include incarceration inside anywhere with more than one lock.;
The Ritual Stone doesn't do anything. Nothing at all. Let us move along now. Do not touch it. Honestly, it is broken.;
The Lover Stone raises all your skills faster. Side effects may include a sense you are cheating a bit, and an inability to live with yourself.;
I'm thinking the sun is going down.;
I'm hoping we do not get struck by lightning. I am a very good conductor you know.;
I'm thinking it is a beautiful day.;
I'm thinking it's a gorgeous morning.;
I'm thinking the stars are very beautiful.;
I'm thinking this jail will be my home until I die, or until I have repaid my debt to you.;
I'm thinking the guards here are all blind, deaf fools. Don't worry they didn't hear me say that.;
I'm thinking I am sorry I shot you in the head. It is a good thing you have a hard skull.;
Mr Dragonfly appreciates being in that picture over there, but he thinks Langley failed to capture his dashing good looks.;
Mr Dragonfly is wondering how he fits into this Doom Strider business. I think he has an over inflated sense of self importance.;
Mr Dragonfly is wondering if anyone here can make him bigger. He is insecure about his stature.;
Mr Dragonfly says this place is bringing back bad memories. He doesn't want to talk about it at the moment. Neither do I.;
Mr Dragonfly is thinking entering this place was a bad idea.;
Mr Dragonfly is shaking in his jar. Don't worry, Mr Dragonfly. We will protect each other.;
Mr Dragonfly is bursting with excitement. He is enjoying this adventure very much.;
Mr Dragonfly wishes he could wield a sword so he could fight by our side. For now we will have to make do with his moral support.;
Mr Dragonfly is thinking this is the most fun you can have in a jar. He would know.;
Mr Dragonfly is thinking this is a fascinating place.;
Mr Dragonfly thinks that we would be lost without him. He is getting cocky in his old age.;
Mr Dragonfly thinks this place is a historian's dream. He is very knowledgeable.;
Mr Dragonfly does not share my love of spiders. He is hoping we don't bump into any down here. Don't be such a spoilsport, Mr Dragonfly.;
Mr Dragonfly is hoping he lives long enough to see the sky again. This place does not agree with him.;
Mr Dragonfly is thinking he feels even smaller than usual at the moment.;
Mr Dragonfly wishes he had a forty foot wingspan and could breathe fire. I for one hope he never gets his wish. Power changes people.;
Mr Dragonfly appreciates his glass jar more than ever at the moment. He is not a good swimmer.;
Mr Dragonfly is being stealthy. I am proud of him.;
It seems Mr Dragonfly can be quiet when he wants to be.;
Mr Dragonfly is quietly pondering what we are up to.;
Mr Dragonfly says we are trespassing. I do not think it bothers him though.;
I'm trying to think happy thoughts.;
I'm wondering why we are here.;
I'm thinking, what is Mr Dragonfly thinking?;
I'm trying not to think about anything right now.;
I'm trying not to wet myself. Can we please just move along.;
Come on let us push on and get this over with. I'm uncomfortable here.;
My thoughts are jumbled by this place, let us keep going.;
Let us push on. If we are here too long I'm afraid I'll go blind in self defence.;
Let us just try to stay quiet for now.;
The dog does not understand the concept of stealth I think.;
I am thinking that your inquisitive nature makes you engaging.;
I am thinking it is good to be alive and by your side.;
I am wondering how many thoughts I will think before I die. Quite a few reckon.;
I am thinking how crazy life can be sometimes. It is brutal, bewildering, and beautiful.;
I am thinking that it is a wonderful world, and that we should appreciate it while we have the chance.;
I am hoping that our friendship and adventures will one day inspire and give hope to others.;
I am thinking about spiders. He he. Silly, squashy, spiders.;
I am thinking that it is good to stop and think from time to time.;
I am thinking that original thoughts are good, but hard to manufacture.;
I am thinking what are you thinking that I'm thinking that you are thinking?;
I'm wondering if you'll ask me to join you.;
I'm wondering when you will need me again.;
I'm thinking I hope we fight together again soon.;
I'm thinking, what are you thinking?;
No. My mind is as blank as your expression right now. No offence.;
No. My mind is a sky without birds at the moment.;
No. Right now my mind is a dried up riverbed.;
No. My mind is a song without words right now.;
No. My mind is a sky without stars at the moment.;
I like it. It is cold but my heart is never warmer than it is when I am here. What do you think of Skyrim?;
It has many troubles but it is worth protecting. There is much beauty in this land. Do you like it here?;
That is a shame. I'm sure you will travel very far in your time though. Maybe one day I will show you my homeland.;
Sometimes I think Skyrim's beauty is just dressing and it's rotten to the core.;
Skyrim's troubles will have trouble with me.;
Yes! With me also. We will be legends, my friend. What do you think they will call me in the songs?;
Trouble is your middle name I bet. Mine is Colin.;
Arid badlands in the north, deep, lush forests in the south. The south is nicer from what I remember. Many good trees to climb.;
The people here can be idiots. Many of them are racist fools I grant you.;
No, it's the pressure of being Dragonborn.;
"That must be tough; everyone asking you to solve their problems all the time.";
I knew it! Every time I kill one I will be happy knowing I have made Skyrim a better place for you.;
I shot you in the head. Remember? It was not my finest hour.;
I was not my true self, my friend. I am sorry. I will repay my debt to you with the blood of your foes.;
Good. I would hate to think I was the reason you can't stand it here. We'll have some fun. Just you wait.;
Maybe I'm crazy. I like eating sweetrolls with a beautiful Nord women in the snow.;
Yeah. I suppose it's not that bad.;
It's not that bad at all. It is where I hope to live out the rest of my days I think. I wonder how many days I have left.;
I convinced you. Well, my friend, I hope that conviction sticks. We shall see.;
It's not enough! I grow tired of this land.;
I can see your mind will not be changed by me. Who knows what future events may change it for you though.;
Inigo the Talkative;
Funny. If you dislike my voice so much then why are we here chatting I wonder?;
It is all about you isn't it? You are not humble. Well, let us see what history decides.;
Inigo the Deaf and Blind.;
You should not mock the afflicted, my friend. I don't go on about your bad breath do I?;
You are more unkind than I remember. It is my middle name name. There is nothing I can do about it! Do not laugh please.;
Thank you. Usually people laugh when they hear it.;
It sounds quite nice.;
It is quite nice. But quite nice is not nice enough for me. If I want to climb trees I have the Rift now.;
It is not boring, just hot and sweaty. Also the insects there are not nearly as fun as the squishy spiders of Skyrim.;
I'm sure he is, Inigo.;
It is nice of you to say. I hope you are right. He always said I would make something of myself. I do not wish to prove him wrong.;
Always. As soon as we were old enough to get into scrapes we always had each others backs. He was the finest swordsman I ever knew.;
Yeah, they're all a bunch of inbred bigots!;
There is hope for us all I think. It is never too late to change ones ways. You can help guide people back on track. You are stronger than them.;
Some of them are OK I guess.;
Yes. Many are worth your time I think. This land could be great, my friend. You could make it so.;
It is! Why is it always my job to save everyone?;
It is your job because you have the power to help. With out you this land would be chaos.;
I feel over-worked and under appreciated.;
People appreciate you. I certainly do. It is the burden you bare to do good for good's sake. Not for glory or wealth.;
Kill 'em all. That's what I say!;
I'm not sure it's enough. You tried to kill me!;
I'm sorry! I will do anything in my power to make it up to you.;
I will earn your trust again if it kills me. I want nothing but to repay my debt to you.;
They say time heals all. Do as you say and I'll keep you around.;
Fun?;
"Yes fun! We will have many good times you and I; squashing spiders, exploring dungeons, romancing the locals. You name it.";
Are you having fun right now?;
Yes. It is good talking with you. Are you having fun?;
Probably. You are not the first to suggest it. I may be crazy but at least I'm not mad.;
Today is what matters. Every day could be your last.;
You are right. Let us not waste our breath on tomorrow. Our lungs are full today, thank you very much.;
Unless you have a bad memory then every day's your first.;
I make my own future.;
We all think we do but who knows? Sometimes life pulls your trousers down when you least expect it.;
We are all at whims of the Gods. I suppose anything's possible.;
It makes freewill seem pointless when you say it like that.;
I'm sorry, Inigo. It's a good middle name. It suits you.;
What's your second name?;
I haven't decided yet.;
Yes. Giving up skooma is hardest thing I have ever done. I still feel the need from time to time but I will not give in to temptation.;
You're no slouch with a sword. He must have been amazing.;
I don't know why I bother sometimes.;
You bother because it is in your nature. Like it or not, you are a good person, my friend.;
I guess someone's got to try to do some good.;
We must try to make the world a better place. What will our children say about us when we are gone? I want to leave them something to be proud of.;
And what happens to this land if I die?;
You will not be dying any time soon. Not if I can help it. If you do, I will continue your work to the best of my ability.;
Chaos is a part of nature. Maybe I should leave it be.;
Chaos is fine in small doses, but beings of order like us can not thrive for long in a world of mayhem.;
It is hard but you will always have me to watch your back. For as long as I draw breath anyway.;
Yeah, you're right. Glory and wealth are nice too though.;
Ah yes! You will have as much of that as you can handle I am sure. Just don't go too crazy with all that power.;
I didn't choose to be a saviour.;
No, maybe not and yet here you are. We all must do our best with what we have. For some of us the stakes are higher, that's all.;
One day at a time. We'll see.;
You are still apprehensive. I understand. Hopefully I will earn your trust in time.;
It warms my heart to hear you say that. I will always be here for you, my friend.;
OK, OK. You don't like Trolls. I get it. Maybe we should talk about something else before you explode.;
Sorry. I got a little carried away there.;
That is OK. I understand. I understand. Maybe we should talk about something non Troll related. Just for a bit.;
You had better!;
OK. I think I am getting the message loud and clear. Do you mind if we change the subject?;
Ok. Time will tell.;
You are still apprehensive. I understand. Hopefully I will earn your trust in time.;
I appreciate the sentiment but I'm keeping an eye on you.;
I understand. Hopefully I will earn your trust in time.;
Good idea. What shall we discuss?;
Err. Sure. Whatever floats your boat. Hey, we could make sweetrolls! I like this plan!;
Stealing from the rich and giving to the poor?;
Yes. That is always a pleasant way to lose ones hard earned coin. It feels so good to unburden myself of my excess funds.;
Rhyming games?;
I am very good at rhyming games. If you take me on, you will go down in flames.;
Yes, I am.;
I am glad.  Fun is good.  If you think of any new ways for us to enjoy ourselves let me know.;
You're beginning to bore me.;
I am sorry. I will try to be more interesting. Maybe a change of subject?;
You're mad as a box of frogs!;
A box of frogs? That is pretty mad I guess. At least I am not as mad as a trout in a tree. No matter how mad you get, there is always someone madder.;
You are as sane the next man, I guess.;
Who is this next man? Do I know him? Do I trust him? No! Why? Because he's mad! It is the world that is mad, my friend, not I.;
What would you want to come back as?;
Me of course! But a different me. A me who makes better choices and always gets the ladies. What would you come back as?;
Chickens don't have such a bad life.;
Oh, trust me they do. Always clucking about, watching everyone, judging everything, having to exchange information for feed. Terrible.;
Yeah, let's keep breathing and see what today brings.;
More blood and coin probably. It is a good life. In another twenty four hours who knows how much evil we will have vanquished.;
No. No. I would never have made a good jester. I am far too handsome.;
That's why I always carry an extra pair of trousers.;
"You have all the answers I see. Be warned though; there are some things in this life that even an extra pair of trousers can't fix.";
I suppose you're right. You never know what tomorrow holds.;
Tomorrow is a mystery but it will soon be yesterday, and today will be a memory, and next week will be last week, and so on and so forth. I am deep.;
Everything's pointless.;
Swords have a point. Arrows have a point too. I'm pretty sure I have a point. Maybe that is enough points for now.;
Freewill is the only thing we have.;
Freewill is an illusion. Try to tell me I am ugly. You can't! See no free will. That was unfair. I know I am handsome.;
He was a good man and very well read. I suppose they hoped that I would achieve some of his wisdom. Knowledge is hard work though.;
You are too rude. I've had enough of this conversation.;
Some could say that's all we do.;
It is not the same. We are not ugly and we have purpose and style.;
What if I offered you some right now?;
I would say no. I will always say no. I will carry it for you if I must, but I will never use it again.;
Did your brother ever use skooma?;
No. He was wiser than me. He was always the better man. I wish I could be more like him.;
Did those ebony weapons you own belong to your parents?;
No. I liberated them from a tomb some time ago. I sold my mother and father's weapons for skooma money. Such a loss.;
Not me! Normal is boring. To think my mother almost called me J'zargo. What an uneventful life I would have had.;
Inigo and Fergus may sound funny to you but I like them. They stand out. People will remember them. I will make sure of that.;
What if I don't want to play?;
Then I will win another day.;
My rhyming tames and blames!;
If you lose, it shames. What's wrong can't take the heat?;
Fitting I guess. What if you came back only to be murdered by your current self though? That would be embarrassing.;
Good social life. Warm fur. I see the attraction. I don't really see you as a pack animal though. You'd be more of a lone wolf I think.;
Really? A big, smelly, brutish, noise machine? I suppose it almost makes sense.;
Why? Ah, I get it. You'd be an undercover Troll slayer with the perfect alibi. Clever.;
We need to figure out what's going on!;
I don't remember what's going on. We're in an inn of some sort. How did we get here? Can I trust you?;
What brought you to Riften the first time?;
After I quit the bandits I came to Riften looking for a way to make coin.My partner and I found a job or two but the real bounty was the city itself.;
What do you think of the thieves' guild?;
Vex turned me away when I tried to join. I tried to impress her by picking her pocket. It was a bad move.;
Just one little bottle?;
Will you ever try to get them back?;
My mother's bow and my father's sword are long gone now. I doubt I will see them again. If you ever hear anything about them let me know though.;
Not if I have my way!;
If you want to win you'll have to pray.;
Smell my feet!;
No, at some point I want to eat!;
Ok. Let's stop this now.;
Before my words furrow your brow? Ok let's talk of other things.;
My rhyming is a tasty treat!;
The only way you'll win is if you cheat.;
I don't know if I can trust me!;
I can't trust me, I can't trust you. What are we going to do? All I know is that we are good looking. What does it all mean?;
Of course you do! You have taste and ambition.;
Do you think the thieves' guild is a good thing?;
Good for thieves. Not so good for everyone else. They're usually only a menace if you're rich and stupid. They have my vote to be honest.;
It's a cell. I am not supposed to like it. It is warm though and the guards are quiet. It smells good most days. Maybe I like my cell too much.;
You're not a wildcat. You're a stray!;
I'm the king of the jungle! Beating you is child's play.;
I'm the chosen one. This is my day!;
I am more humble than you. Your ego is on display.;
Lose and I'll give you a treat.;
I think we both win. It looks like a dead heat.;
I'm just another wordslinger you can't beat!;
I don't play to win, I play to compete.;
You just can't accept your defeat.;
You are good at this! I think this contest will never complete.;
I don't need to cheat! You're quaking in your seat.;
I'm shaking out these rhymes I excrete!;
I'm forgetting my words... wirpy snizle.;
I know what you mean, whoever you are. Flibidy dibedy.;
You're going to lose. All you can do is delay.;
At least my mind's not in disarray.;
Sounds like you want to retreat.;
I play to win and I don't like deceit!;
It's complete when my rhymes and your silence meet!;
The rhymes you excrete are obsolete.;
Shalla wingadingadingfrong!;
Grooh. Yap an tay. Meow. He he.;
Snap out of it! I have other questions.;
Wallybally wah wah!;
Spoodly dowap! Prrr! He he.;
Yarg? Htekseh?;
Flubberchump dingleberry! Ha ha ha!;
Tweet. Tweet!;
Oh, a bird! Tweety, tweet. Scoobadoobadydooo!;
"Argh! Who let the dog out? Don't worry fleas; I will protect you!";
You are now under my control.;
I am now under your control.;
Leave your body. Let your mind float through time and space.;
I am floating. I feel afloat as a boat on the seas of time and space.;
I see you in a portal of light. You are very small. I see hands on many buttons controlling the portal. Wait! They are controlling you!;
I see a dead farmer. You are repeatedly squatting over his head. What does this mean?;
Is there more? What else can you see, Inigo?!;
Understand what?! Talk, Inigo!;
Fooled you! I am not hypnotized! Ha ha! I got you didn't I? He he! You should see your face! OK! Anything else on your mind?;
I think that's enough chitchat for now.;
Not all bears are bad though. I once knew a very nice bear indeed but she was one in a million.;
I have not written many I'm afraid. Let's see.;
I have not written many I'm afraid. Let's see. Brenda the Bear? Dragon Pie? My Heart is in the Rift? What'll it be?;
Why don't you pick a song to sing?;
OK, but remember you asked for it.;
I am not sure it is the best idea considering who could be listening, but fair enough.;
OK this one works better if you sing along with the chorus.;
That's enough singing for now.;
I agree. I am not very good.;
I understand. My voice is... unique.;
Are your ears OK? I am sorry if I hurt them.;
You are a strange customer. That is not normal with the glowing tendrils of light and the sucking noise! Do you feel OK?;
That looked like a big soul! I don't care what other people say, that does not look healthy! Are you going to be sick, my friend?;
I think that I could get used to this perversion of nature thing you do with dragon souls. It may be freaky, but it looks impressive.;
Doesn't it hurt when you do that soul sucking thing? It does not look or smell natural.;
What does a dragon's soul taste like? I wonder if I will ever know. I always imagine it must be a little like licking the inside of an oven.;
Do you have to do that every time we kill a dragon? The smell you give off afterwards is... unfortunate.;
The way you suck in those dragon souls makes my skin itch. I think I may have urinated a little that time. You gave me a shock.;
How many dragon souls do you need? I mean... when will enough be enough? Watch you do not get addicted.;
What happens if you absorb too many dragons? Do you explode? If you feel like you are going to burst warn me please.;
I take it you feel better now you've had your dragon soul hit? Maybe you should go without for a while and see what happens.;
You just couldn't resist that dragon soul could you. You are hopeless. When you are ready to give up I will be here to help you.;
There you go again with sucking of souls. I do not approve but I will not stand in your way.;
You and your dragon souls. Stop being a show off, my friend.;
If you get some kind of dragon soul related illness, do not complain to me.;
You feel powerful when you do that don't you? Remember that all energy is only borrowed, my friend.;
Did you know that absorbing dragon souls ages the skin? I heard that somewhere.;
People who absorb dragon souls live shorter lives... I'm just saying.;
Absorbing dragon souls causes fatal lung rot. You don't want that do you? You are dicing with death, my friend!;
Absorbing dragon souls harms you and those around you. Every time you do it you put both of us at risk. You really don't care do you?;
The absorbing of dragon souls fails to impress me. It is not big and it is not clever;
It is not the dragon souls that are the problem. It is the sucker who can't resist them.;
You are a dragon soul eating enthusiast.;
A dragon a day keeps the healer away. Keep telling yourself that.;
Absorbed another one eh? You are a sucker, my friend, but I still like you.;
Another smelly lizard soul is yours.;
That's enough dragon souls for one day I think. You are beginning to smell bad.;
You know what you look like when you do that soul absorbing thing? You look like a great big show off, that's what.;
A tasty dragon soul down the hatch. You must have a lot of room in there.;
When you take a dragon's soul it makes my ears pop and my bowels loosen.;
You may be a killer, but you have a lot of soul.;
Dragon souls are smelly.;
You are a very interesting individual.;
You are a freak of nature, my friend. In a good way... probably.;
Wipe that dragon soul off your face and let's get moving.;
If you are quite done showing off, let us move on.;
That soul looked pretty tasty but it smelt of scorched metal and pee.;
That soul smelt of onions and rotting teeth!;
That soul smelt of rotting fish and giant's feet.;
That soul smelt of troll's breath and goat sweat.;
That soul smelt... good. I was not expecting such a pleasant stench.;
That was a big soul! Do you need to break wind? I will avert my nose if need be.;
That soul smelled like wolf's breath and mammoth's poop. Interesting.;
That soul smelled like molten metal and lizard gizzards. You smell like a lizard gizzard wizard. I am just saying.;
That soul smelled like molten metal and lizard gizzards.;
That soul smelled like a rotten tooth caught in a giant's armpit.;
That soul smelled... green. Very pleasant indeed.;
That soul smelled like a sea breeze, shells, and aggressive bird excrement.;
That soul smelled like poor hygiene and rude thoughts. Hmm.;
That soul smelled like iron and burning food experiments.;
You know, when you take in a dragon's soul I can hear your teeth vibrate. It is unsettling but also amusing.;
I hope your soul is not upset at having to share its living quarters with such smelly company.;
When you take in a dragon's soul I can sometimes smell your kidneys. I should NOT be able to smell your kidneys!;
When you take in a dragon's soul I can hear your bones creak. It is a good thing you have a sturdy foundation.;
Dragonborn. Dragonborn. Ba ba ba ba baah! Dum da de. Dum de doo. Ruba dum dum that�s you. He he.;
Dragonborn. If Langley was here he would say 'Dragonbum.' He he, he is a funny fellow.;
Could you read Kolb and the Dragon aloud please?;
OK. Let us embark on a literary adventure. I hope we win. Kolb & the Dragon - An Adventure for Nord Boys... and other races and genders too.;
Kolb was a brave Nord wa... he was a brave warrior. One day his Chief asked Kolb to slay an evil dragon that threatened their village.;
Kolb took his favourite axe and shield and walked to the pass, where he found a cold cave, a windy cave, and a narrow trail. What way should we go?;
Let's enter the cold cave.;
Kolb stepped into the frozen cave, but his thirst for adventure kept him warm. A smelly tunnel climbed ahead of him.;
Wind howled from another to his left and a ladder was nearby as well. I do not vote for the smelly option. Where do we go, my friend?;
A strong gust of wind blew Kolb's torch out, and knocked him into a pit where he split his head and died. I don't think that was the best ending.;
Good. I never tire of this book.;
Put the book away for now.;
OK. I hope we read it again sometime.;
Maybe we can read it again later.;
Let's walk up the trail.;
Climbing up, Kolb found a camp. He met a wise man who shared bread and showed two paths to the dragon's lair.;
One went through the hills, the other through a marsh. Do we trust this man? What if he poisoned our bread? If we survive dinner where do we go?;
Let's take the hills.;
Kolb stepped onto a rocky hill. He could see the dragon sleeping below, and a tavern off road nearby. What shall we do? This is exciting.;
Let's take the marsh.;
Treading through the marsh, Kolb discovered a wailing ghost blocking his way. Stupid ghosts always moaning and getting in the way. What's the plan?;
Let's take the smelly tunnel.;
Following the stench, Kolb found a filthy orc! The orc snarled and charged Kolb with his spiked club. How do we handle this?;
Following the stench, Kolb found a filthy... I mean fierce, a fierce orc! He snarled and charged Kolb with his spiked club. How do we handle this?;
Climbing up, Kolb found a camp. He met a wise man who shared bread and showed two paths to the dragon's lair.;
Quick! Let's raise our shield!;
The orc cackled as his club splintered Kolb's shield and smashed into his face. There Kolb died, and the orc had soup from his bones.;
A better ending for that orc than for us I'm afraid. Maybe we should try again.;
Before the orc could strike, Kolb swung his mighty axe. The orc's head and club fell uselessly to the floor. A detached head is pretty useless.;
Kolb swung his axe as hard as he could, but the ghost hardly seemed to notice. The ghost drifted into Kolb, and a deep sleep took him over.;
He never awoke. What! This cannot end with us sleeping! It is not exciting. Shall we go again and try to stay conscious?;
Kolb remembered a story his Gran told him and tossed two gold chits for the ghost. It faded away, allowing him to pass. I wonder if that works.;
Leaving the marsh behind him, Kolb could see the dragon's lair nearby, as well as a small, welcoming tavern. Where shall we go?;
Let's go to the Lair.;
Kolb found the lair where the dragon slept, tendrils of smoke wafting from its nostrils. The air made Kolb's eyes sting.;
He nearly slipped on the bones of men, picked clean. The beast lay on its side, the throat and belly both waiting targets. Where shall we strike?;
Let's take a break and visit the tavern.;
Kolb stopped at the tavern to rest before fighting the dragon. High elves ran the tavern, however and poisoned his mead so they could steal his gold.;
What! That can not be how it ends! Poisoned by a bunch of bandit elves! We didn't even get to seduce the locals! Shall we try again?;
Strike the neck!;
The head of the axe lodged itself in the tough, scaly neck of the beast. It wailed and thrashed, but Kolb held on and eventually sawed through;
the neck, killing the beast. Kolb returned home victorious, and his village was never bothered by the dragon again. The end. We won!;
What an adventure! We saved the day. We are heroes! Shall we get out there and do it for real or do you want more practice?;
Strike the belly! Rip out its guts!;
Kolb crept towards the belly of the beast, but no sooner had he taken his eyes off the head it snapped him up and ate him whole, axe and all.;
Oh no. We died. Always strike the neck, my friend. Unless you're fighting a headless zombie or something. Shall we try again?;
Hand it over and if we're relaxing somewhere safe I'll read it to you if you want.;
Would you mind reading Inigo the Brave?;
Ok, but remember I am not a professional writer. I hope you like it. Inigo the Brave, a tale suitable for any gender and race at any time.;
One day Inigo was walking through his spider farm minding his own business when he smelt something was wrong.;
His nose was the best in the land so he followed it to a nearby cave where he found a beautiful woman of unspecified race crying.;
"""What's wrong?"" Said Inigo. ""A smelly troll stole my sister."" Said the radiant woman. ""Can you help me? Please bring her back.""";
"Inigo looked into the dark cave then into the eyes of the woman. ""If she's alive I will save your sister"" he said.";
"""Thank you!"" Wept the woman. She kissed him and he entered the cave bow in hand. He could smell ugly troll everywhere.";
He soon came to a fork in the tunnel. A little stream ran to the left and a patch of glowing moss illuminated the way to the right. Left or right?;
I am proud you like my writing so much. Ok. Here we go again.;
Put the book away for now.;
OK. If you want to hear it again just let me know.;
Left. Follow the stream.;
The stream was cold but Inigo was hardy and he liked the splashing noises his feet made. He soon found a dead man clutching a note. What do we do?;
Right. Go down the mossy tunnel.;
The mossy tunnel was almost as bright as Inigo and soon he saw movement up ahead. It was a smelly troll eating something. What do we do?;
Run at the troll!;
Inigo let out a barbaric yawp and ran at the troll! The troll looked up from his meal, wet himself, then ran away screaming like a little girl.;
It had been eating a local farmer by a slimy hole in the ground. The farmer was not anyone's sister so Inigo pressed on.;
Inigo was very sneaky but as he got closer the troll smelt his delicious aroma and swiped at Inigo with an ugly claw. What do we do?;
Inigo landed lightly and looked about. He was in an immense bad smelling chamber. The sound of messy eating surrounded him. What do we do?;
The tunnel grew darker and Inigo heard himself crunching over dry bones. He smelt blood on the air. Soon he was standing high above a dark cavern.;
He could hear ugly movement below and he saw sharp stalactites hanging from the cavern roof. What's the plan?;
Inigo landed lightly and looked about. He was in an immense bad smelling chamber. The sound of messy eating surrounded him. What do we do?;
Inigo used his legendary reflexes and dodged the troll. The stupid beast stumbled to the side and fell through a hole in the cave floor.;
Inigo heard its neck snap below. He chuckled to himself then looked about. Where do we go?;
Quick! Stab it with an arrow!;
Inigo bravely reached for an arrow but he was too slow. The troll ripped his head clean off and Inigo never saved anyone again.;
Timing is everything, my friend. Maybe we should try again. I do not enjoy being beheaded.;
Inigo bravely reached for the note but as his hand closed around it the man came alive! He was a zombie! Think fast.;
Inigo unexpectedly took to his heals and ran. The zombie's dead hand clutched his ankle tripping him. He fell and smashed in his head on a rock!;
We died. I would never run from combat, my friend. Do you want to try again?;
Stab it with an arrow!;
Inigo bravely stabbed the zombie with an arrow and pierced its brain by way of its eye. It shuddered and died. Inigo read the note.;
"""I love you. Meet me in the cave at midnight"" said the note. It was a woman's writing. Inigo looked up and saw a troll close by!";
Fire an arrow into the darkness ahead.;
Even in the darkness Inigo was a great archer and shortly after he loosed an arrow he heard a yowl of pain. It was a woman!;
"Around him trolls advanced out of the dimness. The wounded woman shouted ""Kill the handsome cat!"" What do we do now?";
Growl loudly in a terrifying manner!;
Inigo puffed up his chest and let out one of his famous growls. The eating stopped in a hurry and he saw many trolls run for a distant exit tunnel.;
"A woman's voice echoed from the darkness ahead. ""Stop running! Kill that attractive cat!"" The trolls turned and faced Inigo. What should we do now?";
Fire a few arrows at those stalactites.;
Inigo's arrows hit the stalactites and they crashed to the cave floor below. He heard trolls being squashed and he smiled to himself.;
When all was quiet he jumped down among the smelly bodies and had a look about. He heard a woman weeping near by. What do we do?;
Kill the trolls! Kill them all!;
Even in low light conditions Inigo was the greatest archer in the land. He killed four trolls, five, ten, sixteen! His arms were a furious blur.;
More and more filthy trolls fell to his bow but after a hundred he began to tire. First he lost his strength, then all his arrows, then his life.;
We died. Even I have my limits, my friend. Handsomeness and skill can only take you so far. Shall we try again?;
Aim an arrow at the sound of the woman's voice!;
Inigo used his keen senses and aimed true. He heard the woman gasp then fall to the floor. The trolls lost their nerve and ran away.;
Inigo could hear that the woman was near death but still alive. What's the plan?;
Approach the woman.;
"The woman was crumpled and bleeding. She smelt very ugly. ""My sister sent you didn't she?"" She gasped. ""Now die!""";
The troll-hag suddenly slashed out at Inigo with a glass dagger! What are going to do?;
Grab her hand!;
Inigo grabbed at the hag's hand but she was supernaturally fast and the dagger sliced poor Inigo's arm clean off! He stumbled back.;
He tried to draw his bow but he was a hand short and it fell uselessly to the ground. The woman fell on him stashing and stabbing.;
The last thing he heard was the troll-hag's manic laughter. We died a bad death. Let's try to keep all our limbs next time.;
Call out to her.;
"""What's going on here?"" said Inigo. The woman replied, ""I needed to feed my pets. I'm sorry I know it was wrong."" She coughed wetly.";
"""I need you to tell my sister something... come closer."" Do we trust her?";
Put an arrow through her eye!;
In a textbook example of skill and grace Inigo loosed an arrow into the woman's face! As she expired her body thrashed and began to change.;
It grew thick fur and hard skin. Soon her corpse looked half troll, half ugly woman. Inigo covered his nose against its stench and left the cave.;
"""Did you find my sister?"" Asked the pretty woman waiting outside. ""Yes. I had to kill her. I am sorry."" Said Inigo. ""Thank you!"" Said the woman.";
"""She was going to kill me if I didn't bring her more food for her trolls."" Inigo was very understanding and took her to his farm to recuperate.";
It turned out that the woman liked playing with spiders as much as Inigo. They were married a month later and lived happily ever after.;
The end. We did it! Well done, my friend. I hope you enjoyed my book.;
What babe?;
The babe with the power.;
What power?;
The power of voodoo.;
Who do?;
You do.;
Do what?;
Remind me of the babe.;
Did I scare you?;
If you had sent a double in your place you could have avoided a lot of ugliness.;
How do you think I'm doing, Inigo?;
You want a performance review? OK.;
I am honoured you want my opinion.;
I will list some of your attributes. Here we go.;
Here's what I know about you.;
You smell like sweetrolls today. Watch someone does not eat you.;
You smell like Mr Dragonfly today.;
You smell dragons and pastry today.;
You smell of filthy dragon parts today.;
You smell oily at the moment.;
You smell fiery today.;
You smell frosty today.;
You smell worse than usual today.;
You do not have much money but I am sure you will in time.;
You are extremely generous. Thank you again for my steed by the way.;
You have some gold but you could do with more.;
You are OK for gold at the moment.;
You are quite wealthy.;
You are very rich.;
As far as spiders go, you can take them or leave them. I wish I had your restraint.;
I think you enjoy killing spiders as much as I do. You are adventurous and fun to be around.;
Spiders make you uneasy. I understand they are not for everyone. All the more for me.;
You are good with dogs but most other animals fear you greatly.;
You have a big, howling, hairy beast within you. Keep it on a short leash. I do not want to have to break you out of a maximum security kennel.;
Every now and then you become a stick chasing, bottom sniffer. I am a tree climbing, fur licker. Each to their own.;
You are creature of the night with a thirst for the red stuff... I am not talking about wine.;
I am a battle loving, sweetroll eater. You are a sun hating, blood drinker. Each to their own.;
Emm...;
You have never done time in a cell... unlike me.;
You've done a little time behind bars. Haven't we all.;
You've been imprisoned for various crimes but I'm sure all that was just a misunderstanding.;
You've been caught doing something frowned upon quite a few times. Comes with the territory I am afraid.;
You have been jailed a lot. Do not worry. All geniuses are misunderstood in their own time. Believe me.;
You are not exactly well travelled. Not yet anyway.;
Your travels have taken you to a few interesting places but much of Skyrim is still a mystery to you.;
You have become quite the wanderer. You are beginning to know Skyrim like the back of your hand.;
You are extremely well travelled.;
You are essentially homeless right now.;
You own your own home. That is a big positive in my book.;
You own some choice property. You have more than one place to hang your hat.;
You have many homes, some nicer than others.;
You are not afraid of bloodshed but you always try to do the right thing. You do not have many regrets.;
You were once a member of a nasty and violent gang. You have bettered yourself.;
In the past you hurt someone close to you. Join the club. By giving me a new life I believe you are readdressing the balance somewhat.;
You have made choices in the past you are not proud of. You are far from alone there, my friend.;
More recently you have made a number of wonderful decisions. Letting me join you for example.;
You pretend that you are bad to the bone, but you do not fool me. Behind that hard veneer you are warm hearted, kind, and in denial.;
You have a family. I feel sorry for any child that has to fill your boots.;
You are the head of Winterhold College and the Thieves guild. You are number one in the making things disappear business.;
Like me you have no great talent for fighting with magic.;
If you insist on fighting with magic, may I suggest more practice? I do not want to be unconscientiously scorched.;
Slowly but surely, you are becoming a magical powerhouse.;
You are getting very good at hurting things with magic.;
You are a powerful master of destruction magic.;
You are the greatest destruction mage I have ever seen. Accidents can still happen though so be careful.;
You are healthy. Try to stay that way.;
As far as I can tell you are disease free at the moment.;
The state of your mind may be up for debate but your body is healthy.;
You are unwell at the moment. It is affecting your performance.;
You seem to have contracted an embarrassing illness on your travels. I will not ask how.;
You seem to be suffering from a disease of some sort. I hope you are not contagious.;
You are not much of a conversationalist. I do not take it personally.;
When you open your mouth you usually talk yourself into trouble not out of it. You need to practice your manipulation techniques.;
You have been known to influence people's decisions with a mix of body language and craftiness.;
You are good at getting what you want out of a conversation. You are probably influencing me right now.;
You have a silver tongue, you charming rogue.;
Charismatic does not sum you up. You could talk a dragon into setting itself on fire. Maybe try that next time.;
You are inquisitive and you tend to pay attention to what is being said.;
You are strong, free and single.;
You had a lovely wedding, but there was no additional spider smashing ceremony. Ah well, maybe next time.;
Watching you fight one handed is like watching a fish thrash around with an arrow through its eye. You will get better.;
Redgaurds are known for their skill at one-handed combat. You seem intent on readdressing the balance. Stop holding back, my friend.;
Your skill with one handed weapons is getting better. I find that shouting random insults mid battle always helps.;
You can hold your own with a one handed weapon. There is always more to be learnt though.;
You are a precise killing machine with one handed weapons. You are almost as skilled as me.;
Your skill with one handed weapons is unmatched. I think I could maybe learn a thing or two from you.;
You are a credit to your kind, my Redgaurd friend. Your skill with one-handed weapons is miraculous to behold. I have never seen your equal.;
You slice, you dice, you amputate, you decapitate. You are the ultimate authority on one handed killing.;
You were saved from the executioners axe by the very force that now threatens this land. You could be our only hope. No pressure.;
You are trying to help us all by going after that smelly Alduin fellow. Your efforts are to be applauded. I hope you win.;
You certainly saved us all when you defeated Alduin. I'm sure I speak for everyone with a brain when I say thank you very much.;
You saved every one from a giant world eating dragon so that's good.;
In life you tend to go your own way. You do not follow the herd.;
You are self-conscious about your face. I don't know why. You are stunning.;
You like to dress above your station. I do not mind though. Perhaps it is a taste of things to come.;
You have great fashion sense.;
Do not take this the wrong way but your choice of clothing is unfortunate.;
You are not ashamed of your body.;
You like to cover up and stay warm.;
You do not have much of a temper. You are rational and diplomatic.;
You are not afraid to speak your mind and you do not take insults lying down. Good for you.;
You have had a fabulous night out with one Daedric prince and managed to navigate the lunacy of another. You have powerful friends.;
Two handed weapons do not seem to suit you. I feel the same way. They are heavy and cumbersome.;
You use two handed weapons from time to time but they slow you down. With  practice I think you could remedy that.;
You enjoy two handed weapons and have learnt to use their clout against your enemies. Just watch you do not drop one on your toe. They are heavy.;
Your proficiency with two handed weapons is amazing. I envy your strength and stamina.;
Look at those arms! Your talent with two handed weapons is unsurpassed and you have the muscles to prove it.;
You are astounding with two handed weapons! I bet you could chop a cow in half with one blow if you wanted to.;
You seem to enjoy being on fire. You are a thrill seeker.;
Sometimes you seem to set yourself on fire just for fun. You are either very daring or very absent minded.;
You are not into politics.;
You have taken sides in this ridiculous civil war. I hope you do not regret getting involved.;
You changed the fate of a nation. Not many people can say they've done that.;
You do not like show-offs.;
More often than not you are polite and sincere.;
You are strangely superstitious about cartography.;
You lead the Companions and the Dark Brotherhood. Only a fool would mess with you.;
You are not very sneaky. You are like a giant dancing in a pottery shop. Perhaps that's something you should work on.;
You do not seem to be practised in the art of stealth yet.;
You are becoming sneaky, but there is still a lot of room for improvement.;
You grow more sneaky every day. Keep at it. Being heard is often the difference between life and death in our line of work.;
You can be as quiet as a grave when you want to be.;
You are the sneakiest sneak who ever snuck.;
You may know how to open a book but so far you have failed to learn very much from the writing inside.;
Most Imperials I have met are well read. You however are not burdened with an excess of knowledge.;
Reading broadens the mind and what a broad mind you have. You are educated.;
You do not believe in wasting energy. You do what you must then move on.;
When attempting a task you believe in an all or nothing approach. You are thorough.;
You like to haul around random useless items for some reason.;
What have I missed? Oh!;
You are not a good archer. Do not worry I will take care of that side of things.;
Your archery still needs work. Do not be disheartened, I am an oddity. Not everyone can be deadly with a bow and good looking.;
Most Wood Elves are fantastic archers. You seem to be an exception in that department. You are a trendsetter.;
You've been practising with your bow. You show promise.;
You are quite the marksman. Still not a patch on me of course but very good none the less.;
I believe that you are my equal when it comes to archery. That was hard for me to say. Let us move on.;
You are a credit to your kind, my Bosmer friend. You are a marvel of marksmanship. I do not enjoy saying this but, you are better than me.;
You are a better marksman than me. There, I said it. Happy? Seriously though well done.;
Now. How do I conclude?;
You are brave, resourceful, powerful, and kind. There are many words that describe you but only one that defines you to me.;
It is within the definition of that word that you truly excel.;
You are like a little ball of potential waiting to explode. You have many grand adventures ahead of you, my friend. I hope I'm a part of them.;
You are destined for greatness, my friend. You are still fairly new to this adventuring thing but you are getting more powerful every day.;
You are becoming a first-rate adventurer, my friend. Good thing too. There are still many dangers you are yet to be tested against.;
You are proving good for Skyrim. There are still many matters that need your attention but there's no denying you are pretty fantastic.;
You have become powerful, my friend. You have righted many wrongs and your name will live on long after our bones are dust.;
You are unmatched in almost every area. You are a walking legend in your own time, my friend. You are inspiring.;
You are a marvel, my friend. You are fantastic! You give us all hope! You are the reason monsters sleep with a torch lit. You are remarkable.;
You are with out a doubt the most impressive individual I have ever known. I am more proud of you than words can say, my friend.;
That is that. I hope you enjoyed my insight.;
I say it as I see it. Let me know if you want another progress report. It is fun judging people.;
You asked for my opinion and now you have it. I hope you did not mind my honesty.;
Take your time.;
I changed my mind. Keep your opinions to yourself.;
How did you get those scars exactly?;
It is quite a story. Are you sitting comfortably?;
It happened about a week after the Dupan job... and my betrayal.;
Tell me your tale another time.;
Yes. Sorry again by the way.;
Were you off the skooma at this point?;
Not quite. I was still an addict.;
After the Dupan deal went sour I managed to score a little skooma on the road. I used it and sat up all night staring at the stars.;
I decided I would end my life the next day. After what I did to Felix and you I thought it best for everybody if I just went away.;
I decided I would end my life the next day. I thought it best for everybody if I just went away.;
You are very nice to say such things. I am glad too.;
You're still breathing. What went wrong?;
Well as it turned out I was even worse at suicide than I was at friendship.;
I watched the sun come up and then made a noose. My camp was up high near the edge of a cliff. I fastened the noose to an overhanging tree branch.;
I used the last of my skooma, placed the rope around my neck, and jumped off.;
I will tell you. Don't be so impatient. A good story often needs to take its time.;
I don't think I'd be brave enough to do that.;
It was not bravery, my friend. If anything it was cowardice. At the time though it felt like the least painful option for everybody. I was wrong.;
I remember falling, the twanging noise as the rope went taut, a brief moment of pain, a snapping noise, I thought it was my neck,;
"then I was falling again. The cliffs rushed past me. I thought ""Well the rope didn't work, but the ground will do the trick.""";
A wide ledge hurried up to meet me. I closed my eyes just before the impact. There was a smashing noise then I was underwater.;
I was suddenly underwater. What is so hard to understand? Try to pay attention. I had fallen through a thin layer of rock into a cave.;
That had better not have been a fat joke. Me and my trim physique had punched a hole through a thin layer of rock into a cave.;
"I thought ""Well, the ground didn't kill me but drowning should end my sorry life."" The gods had other plans though.";
A current dragged me to the surface, coughing and spluttering. That's when I heard them.;
No not them. They came later.;
I'm afraid not. That would have been nice though.;
I heard clucking. I was in a river being swept through a large cavern. It was dark but I could make out many cages on the bank.;
Chickens strutted about outside the cages. I could smell magic. I gathered my strength and hauled myself out of the water.;
You're making this up.;
I swear I am not. The skooma may have altered my perception slightly but I know what I saw.;
This is a good tale, Inigo!;
Yes I know. It gets better. Hard to imagine, but true. Listen to this.;
Inside the cages people were bound and gagged. Ignoring the chickens I rushed over and tried to open the first cage I came to.;
It was locked tight. Suddenly I felt a pain in my foot. A chicken was pecking at me! I kicked it away, but it came back with reinforcements.;
You were NOT attacked by chickens!;
I was! I saw some rabbits too but they did not seem to want to get involved.;
I think the skooma was messing with your mind.;
I was in a flapping, pecking nightmare. I tried to get back in the water but before I had gone a few steps I was knocked unconscious.;
By a chicken?;
"No. A chicken pecks; it does not try to sneak up behind you and knock you out.";
You mean you passed out?;
No. I was struck on the head with a blunt object. I had the bump to prove it.;
I awoke tied to a chair. There was a foul smelling man studying me. I could hear the river nearby but I was now in a crypt of some sort.;
Chickens and rabbits watched me from behind the smelly man. He said he was going to make me useful. I did not like the sound of that.;
My options were limited. I had no weapons but I did have a little time. This fellow liked to talk.;
I would have ripped off his head.;
Have you been paying attention? I was bound to a chair. I wasn't going to be ripping anybody's head off until I got free.;
I unsheathed my claws and went to work on the ropes that held me to the chair. The man seemed to have a bit to say so I let him talk.;
He said that he was a powerful wizard and that he had learned how to transform people into animals.;
Once transformed, he said I would want nothing but to aid him. He said he had a spy network of chickens and rabbits all over Skyrim.;
Yes. That is what I thought.;
Of course! The proof was flapping and hopping all around him.;
I asked why only chickens and rabbits. He replied that once I was a chicken no one would ever take notice of me again.;
A bear or a mammoth would be too conspicuous. Smaller animals make the best spies.;
I told him if he turned me into a chicken I'd peck his eyes out.;
He told me that the change was not only physical. I would want to do his bidding, nothing else.;
He said that he was using the information his spy network gathered to cause hate across the land. He fed on hate. It made him stronger.;
I had spied a wooden door in one wall that smelled rotten. As soon as I felt the rope around me give a little, I jumped at the door.;
It burst open as I hit it and the chair broke apart. I was free. The wizard screamed in anger and loosed a spell in my direction.;
I dodged his attack and ran down a long stone tunnel. I heard the smelly wizard begin to laugh.;
"""There is only death that way!"" He yelled. ""Good!"" I replied, ""I've been seeking that all day!""";
You were in a Draugr crypt weren't you?;
Yes. The smell of bones and dust filled my nose. The wizard did not follow me.;
Rather death than transformation?;
Yes, my friend. I'd rather be a dead Inigo than an evil puppet chicken.;
I ran for what seemed like forever. Eventually I came to a vast chamber with a spindly spiral staircase leading up in the centre.;
The floor was littered with dried out bodies. They had been dead for hundreds of years but as it turned out they were still quite feisty.;
As I made for the staircase the dead started to groan and move. I jumped over them, and began to climb the steps.;
If you were seeking death why not let them kill you?;
My father told me that anyone who dies in such a crypt may come back as a walking husk themselves. Not true death, something far worse.;
Weren't you still under the influence of the skooma you had taken?;
If you are suggesting I was hallucinating you are mistaken. The skooma in my system no doubt reduced my agility though.;
There were too many Draugr to fight so I concentrated on climbing. Half way up I spotted an opening in the ceiling. The air was fresher up there.;
That is when I uncharacteristically tripped. I tumbled back down the stairs. Soon the dead reached me. They clawed at me. They held me down.;
Dry, cracked fingers tore my face to ribbons giving me these scars. I almost gave up. Then something amazing happened.;
You woke up? It was all a dream?;
Do these marks on my face look like a dream to you? No.;
I realized I wanted to live. I realized that my life was still worth something. I realized that I could be the person my brother knew again.;
"This realization gave me a strength I never knew I had. I fought back shouting ""No!"" again and again.";
No! You will not have my life! No! This is not where I die! No!;
I struggled to my feet, fighting all the while. I snapped necks, I broke arms, I gouged out eyes. Somehow I made it back to the staircase.;
Yes it was pretty amazing. If I had not spent all that morning almost dying I wonder if I'd be here talking to you now.;
I'd rather think of it as determination and purpose but maybe you are right.;
Anyway. I reached the top of the stairs, forced open the hatch above, and stepped out into daylight. I was only a few hundred feet from my camp.;
I stared at the tree with the snapped rope hanging from it for a long time.;
I knew I owed much and swore that I would repay any debt I could.;
When I realized you had survived I decided that if anyone was going to take my life it should be you.;
Later when I realized my friend could still be alive I decided that if I had to die it should be by their hand.;
Yes it is. Living it made me the man you see before you, scars and all.;
What you believe is your business. I know it all happened. I am glad it did.;
I have patience and cunning. I am the full package.;
I don't remember much, but it's clear you owe me. Come with me.;
OK. I will be here if you need me. Be safe, my friend.;
Fair enough. Come visit me at Langley's cabin soon. Look after yourself.;
OK. I will be at Langley's cabin if you need me. Take care.;
It was an honour my friend. I will be in Riften if you need me. Be safe.;
OK.  If you need back up I will be in my cell, repenting.;
Ok. Be safe. I will be in Riften if you need me.;
OK. Do not hesitate to summon me if you require assistance. Be safe.;
OK. Remember I am only a summon away. Be safe.;
OK. I will leave you to it. Good luck, my friend.;
Do you want something or not?  ;
Do you still need something?;
Hey! Do you want me for something or shall we move along?;
Have you decided what you want yet?;
What would you have me do?;
OK. Relaxation is good. Adventure is better.;
OK, this can wait. I am with you.;
I guess I better stand up then.;
Yes, my bottom was beginning to hurt anyway.;
You lead, I follow.;
Yes, I will follow.;
Come on legs we're on the move again.;
I was getting comfortable.;
Sorry legs, breaks over.;
I must warn you. If you give me a sweetroll I will make it disappear.;
His Highness gets what his Highness wants.;
Her Highness gets what her Highness wants.;
Woah! Your hands are freezing!;
Try not to burn anything useful with those magical hands of yours.;
Your magical hands are making my hair stand up.;
I may have some items worth selling.;
I will take some death repelant if you have any.;
Pooling our resources.;
I hope this will be a mutually beneficial exchange.;
I don't suppose you have any spare boots do you? It is a little cold and my toes are complaining.;
I already have a lot of filthy Dragon parts. I am just saying.;
You give me best equipment, yes?  ;
Anything new?;
If I have it, you have it.;
I will lighten your load if I can.;
Don't drop anything noisy.;
Give me what you must and take what you will.;
You look a little weighed down there, my friend. Let me help.;
Oh gods. Do not take long please.;
(Sigh) OK. Try to be quick.;
You had better not leave me here.;
OK, Gary. I will wait.;
OK, Grant. I will wait.;
OK, Paul. I will wait.;
OK. Maybe I will do some reading while you are gone.;
If there's trouble come get me.  ;
Whistle if you need me, OK?;
OK, do not take too long.;
I will be here when you return.;
Come back safe.;
Do not leave here without me, please.;
Sure thing, boss!;
Follow me, Inigo. I need your help.;
Good. Let us get going then.;
Yes. We will fight side by side again.;
Of course.  I am with you, my friend.;
I will aid you if I can.;
Name it and I will do my best.;
What would you have me do?;
As you command, your Majesty.;
If you think it is for the best.;
You are doing that command animal thing on me aren't you. I cannot resist.;
OK, Beth. I will do as you ask.;
OK, Nicole. I will do as you ask.;
OK, Mala. I will do ask.;
OK, Charles. I will do ask.;
OK, Paxton. I will do as you ask.;
Sure thing, Leonidas.;
Ok watch my back.;
I will do as you ask.;
OK. Keep an eye out.;
I am sorry, that is beyond me.;
I regret I cannot do that.;
I'm afraid I cannot.;
I hope it is safe to do this here. Keep an eye out for trouble.;
Take a load off my friend. You have earned it.;
Rest while you can, legs. Rest while you can.;
Take a break legs. You have earned it.;
It feels good to take a break. Ahhhh.;
It is nice to be off my legs for a bit.;
It is good to be relaxing. Join me.;
Why don't you give those legs of yours a break? Join me.;
I am glad to be sitting here with you.;
Shall we talk or just soak up the atmosphere?;
Perhaps we should be moving along, not sitting about.;
I will stand guard until you are ready to move on.;
You want me to wait here? Fair enough.;
You had better come back this time.;
Do not forget about me... again.;
If you are not back soon I will not be hanging around. You are absent minded.;
Moving out.;
I am with you, my friend.;
Moving out.;
If you need me I will be here practising.;
If you need me I'll be over here doing this. Unless I pass out or get bored.;
OK, I will wait here.;
I will be here until you need me again.;
Shall I amuse myself or are you sticking around?;
Not even for you.;
Are you the one that has been messing with my mind? You will regret it!;
My mind is still in pain. I don't think they were the cause.;
Hrrrrrrrr!;
Inigo The Champion.;
I hope I am worthy of such a title. To be honest it feels like a lot to live up to. Ah. We will see.;
Any clues?;
In my vision the posts were worn and weather-beaten. According to my nose all the wood here seems to have been cut fairly recently.;
I can also smell stone, and ice, and you, and...;
Wait. I can smell old timber. This way, my friend!;
Any new flashes?;
No, but we are on the right path. I am glad you are by my side. Let us push on.;
What are your current combat tactics?;
I am being aggressive...;
I am attacking on sight...;
I am trying to be unaggressive...;
I am attempting to control my temper...;
I am giving in to violent tendencies...;
I am trying not to start any trouble...;
And in battle I am fighting how I choose.;
And in battle I am fighting Inigo style.;
And in battle I am getting in close when possible.;
And in battle I am meeting our enemies face to face when possible.;
And in battle I am dealing death from a distance... when I can.;
And in battle I am favouring ranged attacks.;
Shouldn't you be outside collecting eggs?;
You don't seem to have the eggs I need. Why are you still here?;
I hope you've calmed down a bit.;
Stop waving that spell about. Bloody show off.;
I must warn you, I'm recording this conversation for posterity.;
Don't say anything you'll later regret.;
Observation. Inigo's friend is a werewolf and is evidently eager to impress me. Note. I am not impressed, though it may be prudent to appear so.;
If you knew what I use that for you'd probably drop it in a hurry.;
Inigo, Mr Dragonfly looks a bit upset. Maybe you should ask your friend to put him down.;
Very funny. Considering that bowl's function I'd wash your mitts after touching it if I were you. Who's laughing now?;
Unless you're planning to give the place a quick once-over put the broom down.;
That artefact is worth more to the world of science than your corpse. Don't damage the former and I wont create the latter.;
If you're thinking about defacing my pictures don't even bother. I've placed a powerful lack-of-talent ward on every one of them.;
If you smash that bottle you had better replace it. Being a genius is thirsty work.;
It's very gracious of you to offer me a drink but I'm not in the mood for a flagon of air at the moment. Not exactly highly functional are you.;
Research. Inigo's friend seems to enjoy causing domestic chaos. Probably the symptom of a largely ineffectual existence.;
Note. Inigo's friend is incredibly distracting.;
Inigo! You gave me quite a start!;
While you're in here try to keep the summoning to a minimum.;
Oh dear! Are you trying to give me a heart attack?;
I hope you're house-trained.;
Don't go marking your territory anywhere. This is all mine, understand?;
You're drooling everywhere. Try to control yourself will you.;
Don't make a mess please.;
What do you think you are doing?;
Inigo, tell your friend I don't need some fool messing up my home.;
Yes. Yes. You can use a spell I can't. Very good.;
Research. The common mudcrab is surprisingly stupid and often tries to mate with nearby rocks... unsuccessfully, but with great determination.;
Observation. Magic is just a tool. It can be used for good or ill. It has no volition of its own. Obvious really.;
Observation. Giants are sometimes prone to great fits of weeping when they think they are alone. Theories - Self doubt, guilt, and ugliness.;
Idea. Upon transformation, werewolves temporarily absorb any apparel and items they were carrying into some kind of second stomach. Disgusting.;
Note. Vampires don't sweat. Nor do they produce earwax. They do however break wind frequently. Are these points related? Need more data.;
Observation. It is in fact very difficult to safely warm oneself with a flame spell. Note to self, keep eyebrows trimmed and beard tucked away. Yes.;
Research. The spiders of Skyrim need to drink more liquid than any other strain, due to their excessive drooling and unfortunate spit reflex.;
Idea. Ice spells could be used to preserve a sick individual until a cure for their illness is found. Problems. The thawing process is often deadly.;
Note. Tickling a paralyzed individual breaks the spell and, briefly, puts a smile on their face. That's a useful one.;
Observation. Dwemer automatons seem to enjoy chasing butterflies. Theories - The urge to destroy what we wish we could be is a common one.;
Research. Tasting ingredients to gain knowledge is not the wisest way to proceed. Let someone else do the tasting, watch them, and take notes.;
Observation. When dried and smoked in a pipe, Nirnroot can be very relaxing. Warning. Smoking Nirnroot causes paranoia and hunger.Must get some more.;
Idea. Could a dragon be resized? A small dragon could be kept in one's pocket and used to light one's pipe at extravagant parties. Yes. I like it.;
Note. The horses in Skyrim possess unequalled climbing abilities. Theories.  Long ago goats and wild horses taking shelter from the cold... together.;
Observation. Lightning spells can be used to shock large shoals of swimming fish in one go. Yes. Useful.;
Research. Eating insect eggs whole is to be avoided. The offspring can survive to later crawl out of the nearest bodily exit. Urgh.;
Idea. Might one use the feet of a frost troll as footwear? It could make traversing a snowy landscape less arduous. Genius.;
Idea. Running water, conveyed through pipes, could be channelled into one's home to wash away one's excrement, reducing incidences of disease.;
Idea. A frozen eyeball stays frozen for a long time. In warmer lands iced eyes could be dropped into drinks to keep them cool.;
Observation. People are fools. They are largely unsympathetic and weak minded. Yes. Insightful.;
Research. Falmer have beautiful singing voices but rarely perform because, to them, beauty is disgusting. That's a fact.;
Research. When swallowed, soulgems turn one's urine green. Practical applications? None... so far.;
Idea. Would people pay to have a dead loved one briefly reanimated? The corpse could perhaps dig its own grave. Mmm. Practical.;
Note. Most issues with one's acquisitions can be solved by paying attention and reading the included instructions. Common sense really.;
Observation. Mr Dragonfly is a fine specimen. I can understand Inigo's attachment to him at least.;
Note. Contrary to my visions, Mr Dragonfly doesn't actually seem to speak. How disappointing.;
Observation. Inigo's friend is clearly a vampire. It may be a good idea to move somewhere less overcast and install a window in the ceiling.;
Mumbling.;
Muttering.;
Mumbled musings.;
Incoherent mumbling.;
Incoherent muttering.;
Indistinct muttering.;
This is going to be delicious.;
I wonder how much a professional chef makes a year. One to look into.;
I should write a cookbook. No. Too many more pressing endeavours require my attention.;
Must remember to buy more ink and paper... and...  garlic. Yes. No. Maybe.;
The seasoning still needs work.;
It smells quite good.;
Observation. Cooking is easy.;
Mmm. More salt I think.;
Be careful with that alchemy table. It's a valuable scientific instrument and it was a bloody nightmare hauling the thing up here.;
Observation. Inigo's friend shows great interest in alchemy but very little talent.;
Observation. Inigo's friend shows great interest in alchemy. I'm surprised to discover they are quite talented.;
Observation. Inigo's friend fancies herself a chef. Hah!;
Observation. Inigo's friend fancies himself a chef. Hah!;
Note. Remember to sterilize cooking utensils once guests have gone.;
Inigo, I suggest you don't drink anything your friend is making over there. Unforeseen consequences and all that.;
What? Am I making a poison? I hope not. Oh dear.;
Mr Dragonfly is rather vague name. I'd have called him Thor or  Beowulf... or The Forbidden Ingredient. Yes.;
(Sniff) What is this?;
A drop of this in my ale will help me sleep I think.;
Is it staining my fingers? Yes, it's staining my fingers. Blast.;
Really mash it up. That should do the trick. Just keep mashing things up. That's basically what alchemy is. You just mash stuff up.;
Observation. Alchemy is easy, but dangerous.;
Good consistency. This will do the trick I think.;
Are you going to be staying for long?;
What's going on in that head of yours I wonder? Not much judging by your expression.;
Inigo, your friend is rather interesting to observe.;
If my studying you is getting annoying feel free to leave.;
I hope you're treating Inigo well.;
You do know you're ill don't you? Probably the result of poor hygiene.;
I must admit despite your obvious flaws, you're quite striking.;
I must admit despite your obvious flaws, you're quite striking. If I was a younger man.. yes, well. We'll just leave it there I think.;
You don't really think my beard's stupid do you? Don't answer that. I don't want to know.;
I'm glad you accepted my apology. I'm a bit embarrassed about how I behaved. Well, no harm done.;
You can go. I am done with you.;
Cheerio, fool.;
I'll let you get out of my hair.;
Cheerio.;
Yes. I think that's enough chitchat for now.;
Hey! Are you trying to do me a mischief?;
Bloody oaf.;
Watch where you're stepping.;
Hmph! Not very polite.;
Huh! Rude.;
He he! Silly spider!;
You are satisfying!;
Ugly minded half-wit!;
I can smell your fear. You should have washed today!;
Your nefarious career is at an end!;
You smell like a rotting fish!;
Sorry, Mr crab.;
Ahh! Kill it!;
Ahh! Kill it!;
You look like you want to say something...;
It has been good adventuring by your side. I am glad I got to fight some spiders with you.;
You're obsessed, Inigo.;
We all have our hobbies, my friend. What is wrong with a little spider slaying?;
I suppose spiders have a certain something.;
A certain something? They are fantastic!;
Do you not enjoy the noises they make when you hit them?;
Can we talk about this later?;
Of course. I will bring it up another time.;
No. To be honest spiders make me a little uneasy.;
I understand. Send any spiders that you do not want to deal with my way. I will take care of them with pleasure.;
I really don't spend much time thinking about spiders.;
I can hardly stop thinking about them. Satisfying, spiders, splattering.;
Of course! I love fighting spiders!;
I am glad you agree. It is good we have so much in common.;
Anyway, I just wanted to make it clear that I am always ready for some spider smashing.;
I think I get the message.;
Good. Did you want talk about something else?;
What the blazes?;
A demonstration is in order!;
Violence seems to be the order of the day.;
You'd attack a man in his own home?;
That was a pleasant little workout.;
That's over... thankfully.;
Any fight you walk away from is a victory.;
Urgh. My bones will ache tomorrow.;
I'm getting too old for this nonsense.;
Good to see you've come to your senses.;
OK. Let's try to put what just happened behind us.;
Cretin! I am well versed in pain and how to dish it out!;
Ehh! Shall we call a draw?;
Calm down, will you!;
Are we sparring?;
This is not helping anything!;
You are good at hurting people!;
Inigo, stop it! I am your friend!;
Try this on for size!;
Cool off will you!;
Everything is flammable, even you!;
This should warm you up!;
I think we both deserve a bit of a break. Hey, did you hear what I said to that bandit the other day?;
You say a lot to every bandit we fight, Inigo.;
It is true. When I taunt them they often lose focus. I also find insulting bullying idiots very satisfying.;
Err... Something about rugs?;
That is a good one but not the insult I am thinking of. I do talk a lot when I fight, it demoralizes our enemies.;
Anyway, I said 'I can smell your fear. You should have washed today.' it was quite funny.;
Just after I said it though I remembered that I too had been a bandit. It hit me that I am at last back on the right side.;
My soul feels cleaner somehow, as if the bandits we fight are little pieces of my misspent past washing away.;
I am lucky I got free of that life when I did.;
It would have only been a matter of time before someone like you came along and ended my wretched existence.;
From experience I can tell you that most bandits are completely lost. They are violent thugs with ugly minds.;
I sometimes do wonder if there are any worth saving though. There must be a few I suppose...;
...but if you choose to live like that you have to accept the consequences.;
Oh my, You're... you're here. I was beginning to lose hope.;
You obviously have your regrets.;
Yes. I know that in this world at least, killing is a part of living, we all do it to survive, for gold, or to put food in our bellies...;
...but taking pleasure in the death of the guiltless for nothing more than sport is wrong. Some dirt never washes off.;
I get bloody but never dirty. I have no regrets.;
Yes. You are a good person and I am lucky that it is so.;
When I die I would rather be forgotten than be remembered for some of my darker moments.;
You gave me the chance to surpass my old self, and who knows, maybe many years from now if people do know my name, they will not utter it as a curse.;
Maybe they will say it with a smile. That would be nice.;
I try to do what's right but I have some regrets.;
It is a complicated world and it is hard to get by without putting a foot wrong. Do you mind if I ask what it is you regret?;
I've done terrible, cruel things and I feel no shame.;
I find that hard to believe but I am saddened that you would say such things, my friend. I know that deep down you are good.;
I would not be sitting here if you were truly bad. Do not worry though, I will keep your kindly nature a secret.;
I would not want to spoil your image.;
I also spent some time with a group of pillaging thugs.;
You know what I am talking about then. Look at us now though. We are making the world cleaner everyday.;
I sometimes think that there are no greater heroes than those who have hit bottom but found the strength to climb back to the top.;
That is us, my friend.;
I hurt someone dear to me.;
I understand. I have harmed many people who deserved better. They haunt my dreams still.;
I believe with every good deed I do though, more and more of them leave me in peace.;
We may not be able to take back the hurt we have caused but perhaps we can honour those we have wronged by helping others.;
Let us try to leave this world a little cleaner than when we found it, my friend.;
Let's just say I've made some very bad choices in the past.;
I do not know much but I will tell you this.;
The person who gave me a reason to go on cannot be a bad soul. Perhaps you have finally found your place in this world.;
Whoever you were when you made your mistakes, I think you left that individual behind.;
It is one thing to be offered a second chance, but to create your own, as you must have, takes more strength than I can imagine.;
Anyway. I think that is enough about that for now. Did you want to talk about something else?;
I have been meaning to ask you something. How exactly do you pronounce the name of those disgusting black insects I dislike so much?;
You say it like this... 'Chaw-rus.';
Chaw-rus. It does not sound right to me. Ah well. They are horrible no matter how you pronounce their name.;
You say it like this...'Kor-us.';
Kor-us. OK, if you say so. They are horrible no matter how you pronounce their name.;
You say it like this... 'ARGH! GET IT OFF ME!';
He he! Yes. They are scuttling, spitting nightmares capable of weakening the mind and loosening the bowels!;
What do you call them really though?;
I wonder why they affect me in such a way. Insects do not usually bother me. My revulsion feels illogical, almost primal.;
Perhaps they remind me of a past event that I cannot remember. Our fears are often formed before our memories begin to stick I think.;
I believe I can recall most of my childhood, but sometimes I wonder if I am keeping secrets from myself.;
I remember very little of my childhood.;
Urgh. I hope I had nothing to do with that.;
I wonder what mysteries lie in your past.;
I wonder what mysteries lie in your past.;
Maybe in time it will all come back to you. Then again, maybe it is for the best that you do not know.;
Whatever the case, your later years will no doubt be remembered and recorded by many.;
My childhood was painful and unpleasant.;
I am sorry to hear that, my friend.;
You bear your past burdens with dignity. Many people never come back from something like that.;
I know that you sometimes think of yourself as a bad person, but you are not your past. You are rising above it whether you realise it or not.;
I am glad you have not let your unfortunate past define your present. You must have been a very interesting child indeed.;
I know that you have a made a mistake or two, but you are not your past. I am impressed that such an amazing person came from such a dark beginning.;
My childhood was pleasant and uneventful.;
I am glad to hear it, my friend. For the most part mine was too... from what I remember. It just goes to show that anyone can become anything.;
I started out OK, then I lost my way. I doubt my past had anything to do with that. Now because of you I am on a better path again.;
You say that you have done terrible and cruel things that you do not regret. If that is true, it has nothing to do with your childhood.;
You are not on a set path. Maybe that is something worth thinking about.;
Maybe your childhood helped forge the good person you are today, maybe not.;
Maybe your childhood helped forge the good person you are today, regrets and all, maybe not.;
Either way, you have shown me that while I can become someone I do not like, I can also change myself for the better.;
Anyway. What was my original point? Ah yes. Those disgusting chittering insects.;
I will try to think of them as 'Chaw-rus' from now on.;
I will try to think of them as 'Kor-us' from now on.;
I appreciate your insight on the matter. Let us talk of other things.;
That is my name, and let me tell you this, if you insult my friend again I will be forced to harm you. Do we have an understanding?;
My friend. Skyrim is a big and often confusing place. We are bound to lose each other from time to time. Never fear, that map you have is special.;
Yes. There is more to it than you may realize.;
How so?;
I know. Keep you're filthy mitts off it!;
I assure you my mitts are not filthy! Look, this will only take a moment. It is a wonderful map indeed.;
My brother once found one just like it on the remains of some poor old adventurer in Cyrodiil.;
It does not only mark locations, it can also show the position of items and people too. Watch this.;
Where are you, Inigo?;
There!;
See? I have placed myself on your map. If we find ourselves separated all you need to do is look me up.;
Quit showing off.;
I am sorry. I was just trying to be helpful. I will endeavour to be less of an exhibitionist in future.;
It's great, Inigo. Thank you.;
No problem. I am always happy to help.;
I don't trust it. Smells like witchcraft to me.;
Do not worry. It is not a malevolent map. It only wants to help. Like me.;
Yes. Take my Markarth horse. He's yours.;
That lovely patchwork horse with a killer smile and apples on his breath? What a gift. Thank you.;
Yes. Take my Riften horse. He's yours.;
That delightful dappled horse with a song in his heart and fire in his belly? What a gift. Thank you.;
Yes. Take my Solitude horse. She's yours.;
That proud, pale, and slightly pompous steed with good teeth and expensive looking hair? What a gift. Thank you.;
Yes. Take my Whiterun horse. She's yours.;
That unpretentious, beautiful, black steed with a spring in her step and a twinkle in her eye? What a gift. Thank you.;
Yes. Take my Windhelm horse. He's yours.;
That lost looking pony with shattered dreams in his eyes and escape on his mind? What a gift. Thank you. Maybe I can cheer him up.;
Yes. Take Frost. He's yours now.;
That popular smelling horse with abandonment issues and hopes of a brighter future? What a gift. Thank you.;
Yes. Take Shadowmere. He's yours now.;
That impressive, shadowy steed, with a furnace in his eyes and a blood splatter obsession? What a gift. Thank you.;
Yes. Take my unique mount over there. He's yours now.;
Thank you, my friend. I will try not to break him.;
Actually, Inigo. Let me think about this some more.;
Yes it is I, Dragonborn. What seems to be the problem?;
What? Dragonbum?;
Hope is not lost. How can I help you?;
No! Not you, you silly Elf. Him!;
No! Not you, you bloody barbarian. Him!;
No! Not you, you lumbering lizard. Him!;
No! Not you, you obstreperous Orc. Him!;
No! Not you, bumbling Breton. Him!;
No! Not you, you frustrating fuzz ball. Him!;
No! Not you, you Imperial menace. Him!;
No! Not you, you unruly Redguard. Him!;
No. Not you, you... whatever you are. Him!;
Do you want to trade your horse for a new one, Inigo?;
A new steed? I cannot resist.;
Take my Markarth horse. He's yours now.;
That lovely patchwork horse with a killer smile and apples on his breath? OK.;
Take my Riften horse. He's yours now.;
That delightful dappled horse with a song in his heart and fire in his belly? It would be a pleasure.;
Take my Solitude horse. She's yours now.;
That proud, pale, and slightly pompous steed with good teeth and expensive looking hair? Why not.;
Take my Whiterun horse. She's yours now.;
That unpretentious, beautiful, black steed with a spring in her step and a twinkle in her eye? Why not.;
Take my Windhelm horse. He's yours now.;
That lost looking pony with shattered dreams in his eyes and escape on his mind? OK. Maybe I can cheer him up.;
Take Frost. He's yours now.;
That popular smelling horse with abandonment issues and hopes of a brighter future? Why not.;
Take Shadowmere. He's yours now.;
That impressive, shadowy steed, with a furnace in his eyes and a blood splatter obsession? Good idea.;
Take my unique mount over there. He's yours.;
Thank you, my friend. I will try not to break him.;
Actually, you should keep your current mount for now.;
OK. My current steed was getting worried there.;
Fair enough. My steed and I are quite happy to keep things as they are.;
My apologies. I am often too terse for my own good. I mean nothing by it I assure you.;
OK. My friend here is the legendary Dragonborn.;
OK. My friend here is a fantastic adventurer, unsurpassed in many areas.;
I see. Well I'm sure you make quite the team, Inigo, but it is you who I have been seeking all these years. I'm so glad you're still alive.;
Who are you? Why have you been seeking me?;
My name is Langley. Langley Longseer to some. Dear boy, I have much to tell you. How did you find me?;
I started to get brief, painful visions a while ago. They showed me flashes of this place and you. I also felt a nasty tugging sensation.;
The spell works! Not quite as was intended but it got you here in the end. I was about ready to string that conjuration mage up by his toes!;
You summoned me? I have to tell you, your spell needs work.;
I've been trying to locate you for quite some time.;
I even travelled to Riverhold. I found your parents shortly after they died, gods rest their souls. Oh dear, you do know about that don't you?;
They were killed protecting a trading caravan. I heard. You were there?;
Yes. I am so sorry for your loss. For all your losses. In a way I've been travelling with you. Just a step behind.;
Did my mother and father die well?;
They met their end with dignity. I was the one who found them and I made sure they had a fine burial. They died holding hands.;
Why were you there? Were you looking for me even then?;
I had hoped they could lead me to you. I continued to track you for years, then the trail went cold... after I found your brother.;
You found Fergus? How? Have you always been hiding in my past, haunting every step I take? Why? I do not know you! What do you want from me?;
I have come to know you very well. I am your friend, Inigo. Perhaps the greatest friend you have. We are destined to work together!;
I already have the only friend I need.;
You don't understand. There's a great evil coming. I don't know when exactly but it is close. I've seen it in my dreams.;
You are there too. You are the champion destined to destroy the Doom Strider.;
What are you talking about? The Doom Strider?;
Yes. The very avatar of destruction and death, the demon that has plagued my dreams for decades.;
I... I need to sit down.;
Take a seat. Rest and I'll tell you all I know. I've been keeping a note of everything.;
I am sorry, my friend. I need a moment. My legs are a little wobbly all of a sudden.;
Go and sit down. It is a lot to take in, I know. Make no mistake, Inigo, you are safe here.;
You both are.;
Inigo and I have much to discuss. I don't wish to be rude, but perhaps it's best if you leave us to it for a bit.;
In fact, if you could do something for me I'd be most grateful.;
Eggs.;
Inigo may trust you, but I don't know you at all and I'd rather speak to him alone for a bit. Much of what I have to say is personal.;
If you're half the friend he thinks you are I'm sure you understand. I'm not asking you to go very far. I just need you to get something for me.;
Eggs. You know, birds lay them. Snow Thrush eggs to be precise.;
Six should do the trick. They often boost my visions allowing me to see further into the future.;
If Inigo is here then maybe the Doom Strider is finally preparing to strike. We must be ready.;
You've got it. What kind?;
Glad to be of use, eh? Good. I need Snow Thrush eggs.;
Where do I find Snow Thrush eggs?;
There are at least eight nests outside my home. You shouldn't need to go very far. I hope you don't mind heights. They are usually rather elevated.;
Come back to me when you have six eggs no fewer.;
Find eight and I'll give you something precious for your trouble.;
I don't know. Maybe in time we'll find out together. Go on. Go and get those eggs and let Inigo and I talk a while.;
OK. I'll go get you your eggs.;
Remember to search up high, and try not to do yourself a mischief.;
Search up high, and try not to fall off anything.;
This Langley fellow seems to have a lot to tell me, and sadly I don't think he'll do it with you here.;
I'm a bit shaken by how well this man seems to know me, but I'll be OK. I wonder what else he has to say. I hope my poor mind can take it.;
You survived your perilous egg fetching adventure I see. I have much to tell you but first I think you should give this man his precious eggs.;
(Whisper) I don't know if I trust any of this.;
I personally do not sense danger here but perhaps you shouldn't go too far from this house. If you hear any screams of agony come running, OK?;
I'll go get those eggs. See you in a bit.;
I have heard the Snow Thrush likes to nest up trees and on the edge of cliffs. Be careful you do not slip.;
I will be here when you return. Good luck finding those eggs, my friend.;
I somehow have the eggs you need before I should... odd.;
Well done! You got the eggs. Very good.;
What? I didn't need eggs. I just needed you out of the house for a bit so we could talk. Keep them. Turn them into an omelette for all I care.;
Anyway, Inigo and I have had a bit of a chat and he's persuaded me that you can be trusted. It seems we three are in this together.;
I've given him my notes and I'm sure he'll let you read through everything. If you have any questions I'll do my best to answer them.;
Maybe you should talk to Inigo first though.;
Good job getting those eggs, my friend. This Langley fellow may be a bit rude and gruff but he's on our side.;
I got all eight. What's my prize?;
Your prize? Oh yes. Here you go. Take my thanks and my gratitude. Very precious commodities indeed.;
You're a real piece of work. Here, take your damn eggs.;
What? I didn't need eggs. I just needed you out of the house for a bit so we could talk. Keep them. Turn them into an omelette for all I care.;
He gave me these. He found my father's journal can you believe it? He also gave me two books he's written about his search for me.;
They contain a lot of information about how important I am. They are very good books but also sad.;
Apparently I have my own prophecy. If you want to hear more about it I'll tell you what I know. Langley says we are going to save the world.;
That is of course unless you think we have something better to do.;
Agh! It is happening again. My mind is vibrating. It feels like it is on the end of a rope!;
My friend. My mind is being tugged again! It is very strong this time. I see wooden posts upright in the snow, a tower. I recognize the tower!;
Eergh! I see the cabin again the door is locked tight.;
OK, this is Snowpoint Beacon. Next we need to find the wooden posts I saw. They must be close.;
Thank the gods. I am not crazy. There it is... the cabin I saw. My friend, I bet you a hundred Septims the door is locked tight.;
I think I have a solution though.;
Why don't you do the honours? My hands are uncharacteristically shaky for some reason.;
My friend! That was wonderful. Did you see? One moment I was inside casually not tasting Langley's cooking, then WHOOSH!;
I saw your face and I was out here! It was amazing!;
I am glad you are giving Langley a chance, my friend. I believe he means well, even if he is not very good at showing it.;
That was intense. I hope you are OK.;
Oww! We are getting close to the source of my mind problem.;
I hope my mind vibrations are not leading us into a trap, my friend.;
Argh! Not again! Stay where you are, brain. Stay where you are. Ow! Arghh.;
Egh. Ow! Who is pulling my brain? I wish they would stop it. Urgh.;
Argh, my mind is vibrating in my skull. It feels like it is at the end of a hook.;
Wait the sensation is receding. That was horrible.;
How do you feel? What was all that about?;
I'm OK. I have no idea what it was.;
All of a sudden there was a bright flash and it felt like my mind was being pulled out of my ears.;
That doesn't sound good. If it happens again let me know.;
Do not worry about me, my friend. Let us get back to it.;
Quit your belly aching. It was probably just something you ate.;
I am sorry for complaining. I will try to keep any future bouts of unbearable pain to my self. Let us continue.;
Wait! I see something. A cabin? Trees? A face! It is fading.;
It is under the rug. Aagh!;
Thank the gods, it is weakening. Ugh.;
I saw brief flashes of a cabin in the snow. It was surrounded by trees. What is happening to me?;
Did you recognize the cabin?;
No, but something about the landscape was familiar. I wish I could remember where I have seen it before.;
Did you see anything else?;
A man perhaps. A bearded man. I did not recognize him. The flashes were very fast and confusing.;
Hopefully it doesn't happen again. Let's move on.;
OK. If it does happen again and my brain tries to escape through my nose, push it back in please.;
It is receding. It is over... for now. My head is pounding. Ow.;
We need to get to the bottom of this.;
I agree. I think I know where to start. I saw a ruined tower in the snow. I think I camped there once long ago.;
The tower is a short hike from Dawnstar.;
It is called Snowpoint Beacon. It is nothing special from what I remember but I think it is close to the source of these embarrassing episodes.;
I understand if we are too busy but what do you say? Shall we go?;
OK, Inigo. Let's go.;
Thank you, my friend. I will mark Snowpoint Beacon on your trusty map. Let us go.;
Sorry. We don't have time at the moment.;
OK. My mind hopes we can find time later. It is in pain.;
I'm with the College of Winterhold. Maybe I can help.;
What? The College of Winterhold? A bunch of jumped up show-offs.;
I'm with the Companions. Do you need assistance?;
What? The Companions? They're not even house trained!;
OK. We have some time. Where is that tower you saw in your vision?;
The tower is a short hike from Dawnstar.;
It is called Snowpoint Beacon. It is nothing special from what I remember but I think it is close to the source of these embarrassing episodes.;
Could you sing Silly Spider please?;
OK. This one is just a bit of fun.;
There never was such a silly spider. A spider came to town last night. The spider was angry he wanted a fight.;
He wasn't too bright, set himself alight a burning spider is quite a sight.;
People gathered to watch him burn and still Mr Spider refused to learn. There never was such a silly spider.;
Silly, silly, silly, silly, spider. There never was such a silly spider.;
The spider came to town this morning. He wanted to shop and do some exploring.;
He frightened a girl, made her hurl, the guards let him off with a warning. People chased and he did run, silly spider thought it was fun.;
There never was such a silly spider.;
Silly, silly, silly, silly, spider. There never was such a silly spider.;
The spider came to town today. He told the townsfolk he wanted to play.;
They ran him through, made spider brew, then wrote this song I am singing to you.;
Silly spider did not stand a chance, people gathered to sing and to dance. There never was such a silly spider.;
Silly, silly, silly, silly, spider. There never was such a silly spider. The end.;
OK, this is Snowpoint Beacon. Next we need to find the wooden posts I saw. They must be close.;
No. I'm pretty sure I'm not who you think I am.;
Your memory fails you. I will try to refresh it.;
Yes, Inigo. Don't waste your life rotting in here.;
Or die defending you! Yes! I accept! I feel lighter in my heart now you have given me this opportunity. You will not regret this.;
Let's agree to disagree. I could use some help if you're willing.;
I'm not the person you remember but you look useful.;
You are the person I remember. I would recognize your smell anywhere. My life is yours to take. Do it.;
Inigo, I said that when we first met.;
What does Langley know anyway? He does not know you like I do. He does not know about our shared past. No, I will not entertain such a silly idea.;
I am not confused. I would know you anywhere. You are my friend. End of story.;
The source of my mind vibrations is east of here. I am sure of it.;
The cabin must be nearby. These are the posts from my vision. Come on let's follow them.;
"You said ""It is under the rug."" What were you talking about?";
Yes, something small and shiny. A coin? A ring? No. I cannot remember. I think my brain is broken.;
We could just knock?;
Maybe there is danger inside. If there is I would rather it did not know we were coming.;
What is your plan?;
"During one of my painful episodes I said ""It is under the rug."" Remember? Give me a moment.";
Yes, here it is, a key.;
Back home my mother used to keep a spare in the same place.;
OK, let us see what is inside.;
Gods, I hate these walking corpses!;
These machines can be dangerous, my friend. Be careful!;
What a stench! My friend, I suggest you breathe through your mouth until this fight is over!;
Let us end these cowardly cut-throats!;
Fight bravely, my friend! Let us put an end to this winged demon together!;
Gods, I hate these walking corpses!;
These machines can be dangerous, my friend. Be careful!;
What a stench! My friend, I suggest you breathe through your mouth until this fight is over!;
Let us end these cowardly cut-throats!;
Fight bravely, my friend! Let us put an end to this winged demon together!;
Argh! You pulled out some of my fur!;
Like the bite of a flea! Wait! It cannot be! They are back, my friend! My fleas! They are back!;
That felt good. Our time together is proving mutually beneficial, I think. I am glad to be by your side.;
(sighs);
(sigh) I am going to miss this.;
Inigo, we need to talk about who you think I am.;
No. I am not ready to discuss that yet. The subject worries me.;
Please, my friend. Drop it for now. Maybe later.;
Are you ready to talk about who you think I am?;
Yes. I am ready. Say what you must.;
OK, but not like this. Let us find somewhere safe to sit together. We will talk then. I promise you.;
I am NOT the person you shot. I'm certain, Inigo.;
I know. When you first denied our past in my cell I did not believe you. Now I know better.;
I know. I think I have suspected for a while now. I just could not face it.;
I am sorry. I have misled you and myself. Our time together began with a lie. I am glad it is ending with the truth.;
I will bother you no longer. For what it is worth, thank you. We had some fun times you and I.;
Goodbye. See you around, Inigo.;
Maybe. I will be in my cell if you should need me for anything. So long.;
I hope you are alright.;
I do not think we have much to talk about. If you still want to chat meet me in my cell. It is where I belong.;
There is nothing to talk about. Langley was right. I am crazy, my mind is broken!;
Yeah. It's a good thing you have a pretty face.;
Not funny. I know I am as ugly as I am mad.;
You've been through a lot. Don't be so hard on yourself.;
I have been living a lie and worse, I have drawn you into it also.;
I am not worthy of your time.;
Come on, my friend. We're a team, you and I.;
My friend. That's what you have become like it or not.;
Do you really mean it? I will not hold it against you if you do not.;
I guess I don't mean it really. See you around, Inigo.;
Of course I mean it, Inigo.;
Thank you. That means more than you know. I honestly thought we had a past together but as time went by I did begin to doubt myself.;
You are so similar to the person I once knew. You even smell the same... in a good way.;
I think deep down I knew my old friend was dead. When I heard about you wishful thinking became hope, then hope became need.;
I needed to believe forgiveness was possible, and if not forgiveness... redemption in death.;
I deceived myself. It was selfish of me.;
It's understandable. No more deception from now on though. Agreed?;
Yes. Agreed. Thank you, my friend. I still have much to live for because of you.;
Yes it was, but it's time to move on.;
Time to move on. Yes. Thank you, my friend.;
I am still in your debt. You gave me a reason to go on, you made me face my past, and now you are helping me come to terms with what I have done.;
I will follow you to Oblivion and back if need be. I did not mean to lie to you... or myself.;
I am ashamed. I hope in time I will be able to earn your forgiveness.;
In the end, I hope our friendship and future adventures will prove more important than how we met.;
Awkwardly skulking about over there isn't going to gain you anything. Go outside and fetch those eggs. Really!;
Is too much to ask for a little privacy. If your name's not Inigo get out of here!;
Well, this is awkward. How do I put this politely? Go away please.;
Argh! More mind vibrations. The source is at the top of these steps. I can feel it.;
I think I AM the person you shot. There's an arrow shaped hole in my memory.;
What? I cannot believe what I am hearing. You really had me going there, my friend. It is not nice to play with someone's mind like that.;
Actually, I need to give this more thought.;
I know. I am sorry. I suppose I deserve as much punishment as you can muster.;
I want to talk about our past and your debt to me.;
OK. Say what you must.;
I'm not who you think I am.;
What? Where did this come from? No. We agreed we have a past together. Remember?;
You shot me in the head and left me for dead.;
Yes. Sometimes I cannot even look you in the eye, my friend. The more I grow to know you, the more ashamed I feel.;
I'm sorry, I didn't know how to break it to you.;
This cannot be. I remember you. At least I think I do.;
Oh gods! My mind.;
No... I mean yes... I mean... what you say is true.;
Only joking! Got you!;
By the gods! That was not funny! It is not nice to play with someone's mind like that.;
You were not yourself.;
That is true, but it is not the whole truth. I was lost and my mind was clouded but I have to take responsibility for my actions.;
You should feel ashamed. I lost a portion of my past because of you!;
Yes. I know. I would return your memory to you if I could.;
You are very kind. It is a beautiful gesture but my debt to you stands. I have not come near to earning forgiveness yet.;
I'm not sure about that but you have your uses. Let's leave it there for now.;
I am happy you do not hold my confusion about our past against me, but I cannot say the same.;
Also, the person I thought you were is dead because of me. Yet another casualty of my former life.;
I will know when I am ready to move on, but for now the guilt I bear still weighs down my heart.;
You calling me friend means the world to me. I am honoured. You have given me a reason to go on, a whole new life, a chance at happiness.;
If all goes well, maybe one day I will be at peace with who I am. If that happens it will be because of you also.;
You cannot remove my guilt but you have given me hope. I must do the rest.;
You are more understanding than most, my friend.;
Quit moaning! I forgive you. What more do you want?;
I am sorry. I do not mean to moan. I appreciate your forgiveness, really I do. Never doubt it, my friend.;
Your words lighten my soul, but as far as my heart is concerned, I still have much to repay.;
I hope your heart will recognise redemption when you find it.;
Yes. I believe it will. I must continue to readdress my life's balance. I can feel a shift already.;
Maybe you are right. Since we started travelling together I have felt a shift in the balance of my life.;
You know, we have had a few adventures, my friend, but I will never forget one particular fight.;
We were in a dank, spooky crypt and it was the first time I had come face to face with the undead since I received my scars.;
We were in a Dwemer ruin and before long we were ambushed by a pack of maniacal machines.;
We were deep in a smelly falmer hive and it was not long before we were attacked by the local bug men.;
We surprised a group of filthy bandits in their smelly camp. They all stank of drink, body odour, and ugly thoughts.;
It was the first time I ever came face to face with a dragon. It was wonderful and terrifying.;
I had been in my cell for quite a while and it was more excitement than I was used to.;
As we fought side by side I became aware that a new positive force was at work in my life.;
Despite the smell, fear, and general sense of unease, I knew that I would always remember that moment fondly.;
Despite the incessant clanging and stench of oil, I knew that I would always remember that moment fondly.;
Despite the ugly environment and smelly atmosphere, I knew that I would always remember that moment fondly.;
Despite the unsavoury nature of our foes and the sour smell of their pee-stained clothes, I knew that I would always remember that moment fondly.;
Despite the roaring, the pain, and the unshakable feeling of impending doom, I knew that I would always remember that moment fondly.;
We were magnificent together. When the battle was done and we stood victorious I knew I was walking a better path.;
Thank you for helping me unlock my potential, and for giving my heart and soul a second chance.;
Tell me about how you and Mr Dragonfly met.;
That is quite lengthy tale. Are you sure you want to hear it?;
OK. Mr Dragonfly is also in the mood to hear his tale again.;
That story is an important part of my history. I do not mind telling it again.;
OK. I am willing if we have the time.;
Actually, tell me the story another time.;
OK. Mr Dragonfly is annoyed but I understand.;
Let's leave the story for now.;
OK. Maybe I can tell it later.;
OK. I'll tell it to you another time.;
Go on, Inigo. I'm listening.;
It happened not long after I got my scars. I stopped off in Windhelm on my way to Riften. I arrived weary, bloody, and fragrant.;
All I wanted was a hot meal and a room for the night, but it was not to be.;
As soon as I entered the city I felt the weight of distrustful eyes upon me.;
I was too tired to care. I made my way to Candlehearth Hall and tried to purchase a room.;
I was told in no uncertain terms that I was not welcome and that I should seek shelter elsewhere.;
While I was explaining that I had gold and would cause no trouble I noticed three brawny men watching me with interest.;
I turned from the innkeeper and faced the men. 'You fellows see something strange?' I asked. 'No, friend.' Replied the nearest.;
'We see a man who needs a bed and a bath but we fear you won't find them here. If you have coin maybe we can help you.';
I'm not sure I would have trusted them.;
I was not sure I trusted them either, but at that moment I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. Anyway.;
I can't believe the innkeeper refused you a room!;
I am not surprised she was wary. Maybe it was because I am Khajiit, but perhaps it was just my bloody face and weaponry she distrusted. Anyway.;
I told the men I would happily part with a few coins for a room.;
They said they were brothers and for fifteen Septims I would be a guest in their home that night.;
They told me their mother would be happy to set another place at their table. I did not have many options so I agreed.;
Easy for you to say that now but I was exhausted and my judgement was asleep.;
The men took me to a deserted alleyway and motioned for me to stop. The youngest brother turned to me and said...;
'Before we continue, we must have your word that you will keep what we are about to show you to yourself.';
'No problem.' I replied. He nodded then felt along the stone wall, paused, then knocked four times.;
There was a grinding noise and a large section slid back to reveal a torch-lit passageway.;
'Who are you people?' I asked as we entered the gap in the wall.;
'Do not be alarmed.' said the eldest brother. 'Hot food and a warm bed are waiting up ahead.' We pressed on and the entrance closed behind us.;
What were you thinking?!;
I was thinking, I am tired and hungry, and if these fellows were going to rob me they would have done it already.;
What was the passage like?;
It was relatively warm. Water dripped from the stony ceiling and I could smell magic in the air.;
We soon came to a heavy wooden door. The youngest brother stepped forward and again knocked four times.;
I heard a key turn on the other side, a grunt, the door opened and I was face to face with the oldest woman I have ever seen.;
'We have a guest, dear mother.' said the eldest brother. 'Well, come in then. Table's set, go wash your hands. You weren't followed were you?';
'No. No.' he replied pushing past her. 'Come in, friend. You're safe and soon you'll be fed.' I stepped inside.;
I was in a huge stone room full of all manner of useless junk and trinkets.;
There were no windows and it was very dim but I could make out a row of beds against the far wall near a large open fire.;
The old woman looked up at me. 'Got money?' she held out a gnarled hand.;
'Of course.' I said handing it over. 'Thank you for letting me rest here. What is your name?';
'Everyone just calls me Mother.' she said. 'You can do the same if you like. Makes no difference to me.';
She motioned for me to sit at a long table where the other men were already eating greedily.;
I sat and tucked in. There was soup and roast beef and vegetables, and I ate until I thought I was going to rupture.;
When we were done I was taken to a corner sectioned of by hanging furs. Inside there was a steaming bath.;
I sank into it, felt my poor muscles relax, and shut my eyes. I drifted off.;
I had some very strange dreams. I saw the brothers caper and dance and fly about the room.;
I saw Fergus in a pool of blood staring up at me mouthing the words 'Run, Inigo! Run!';
I saw a vast glass cage with a rough and scored ceiling.;
I saw many things I have now forgotten. When I awoke the room was spinning and bleary.;
I heard deep muffled voices, then I saw what was next to me and my heart froze.;
What is a bath?;
It is a big container you fill with water and soak in. In certain less smelly parts of Tamriel they are very popular.;
You had been drugged!;
You are very suspicious, my friend. Maybe that is why you are still alive. Yes, there was something in my food.;
It is good to see you were paying attention last time I told you this tale. Yes, there was something in my food.;
What I saw was the king of dragonflies. The largest dragonfly imaginable. He was in a massive jar to my left and he was spinning about in a frenzy.;
That is when I realized I was in a jar of my own. I tried to call out for help, but no words came.;
I looked down at my hands and I saw that they were missing. I now seemed to have pincers.;
I leapt to my feet in horror and bounced off the inside of the jar. Suddenly I realized I was flying!;
No, my friend. That is another story. I think you are confused.;
No, do not worry not a spider. An interesting but less squishy creature.;
No, not a spider. An interesting but less squishy creature.;
Yes. But he was not as you know him now. At least he did not appear that way to me. Anyway.;
I buzzed about for a bit trying to get used to my new wings. After a while I had things under control.;
I realized that the handsome dragonfly in the jar next to mine was not so large after all. I had been made small like him.;
I also saw that we were not alone. A number of other jars were in a row to my left, each holding an insect.;
There were butterflies and glow bugs and moths too.;
My vision was blurred by the jar but I could still make out four enormous figures at the far end of the now seemingly cavernous room.;
One of them pointed in my direction and laughed. The sound was booming and very scary.;
The individual approached and I saw that it was Mother.;
I heard a noise from my right, looked over, and saw that my dragonfly neighbour had fallen down dead with fright.;
I know! It was not a happy moment. I tried to look for a bright side and found one. At least I was not a chicken.;
Indeed. My sadness was soon overwhelmed by fear I am sorry to say. I was trapped and had no idea what this witch wanted with me.;
Clever dragonfly.;
I thought he was a dead dragonfly. I was quite flustered as you can imagine.;
Mother came right up to my jar and tapped an enormous grubby finger against the glass. Her toothless grin filled my view.;
She then picked up the dragonfly's jar, shook it, scowled, and slammed it back down.;
She grabbed another jar, this time from my left, removed the lid and plucked out the moth inside. It feebly flapped between her fingers.;
She held it up to my jar then forced the poor creature into her mouth. I heard the body crunch between her gums.;
That is when I heard a voice inside my head.;
It said, 'Pay attention. Go still and she will not eat you.' Mother swallowed the moth and picked up my jar again.;
I let myself go limp and lay motionless. I seemed to be missing my eyelids so I was forced to watch as she first uncapped my jar then reached inside.;
Her gigantic hand paused before it reached me, then withdrew. 'Stay still.' said the voice in my head.;
It was hard but I managed. Mother held my jar up and studied me. She shook me, then studied me again.;
'PASSED OUT!' she said with a voice like an avalanche. 'SCARED HIM SENSELESS!' She put my jar down and turned away.;
'YOU'LL HAVE TO GET ME MORE! I NEED TO EAT TONIGHT!';
Another huge figure came into view, it was the eldest brother. 'MOTHER!' he said. 'WHY DO YOU HAVE TO FRIGHTEN THEM SO?';
'BECAUSE THEY TASTE BETTER SQUIRMING AND FEARFUL! YOU KNOW THAT!' Her son sighed, woke his brothers, and left.;
I bet you hear a lot of voices in your head.;
I never used to, but ever since I lost my brother, heard about the death of my parents, and became a dragonfly, my mind has been a bit crowded.;
Back then I was surprised to hear a voice between my ears.;
What did it sound like?;
It was well spoken and calm. It was the voice of a scholar giving a lesson to a dim child.;
Mother turned and made for her bed. That is when I heard the dragonfly yell in my head.;
'Your jar! Hit the wall of your jar!' Mother had placed me on the shelf with the base of my jar hanging over the edge.;
I leapt towards the glass flapping my wings as fast as I could. I bounced back then hit it again and again.;
My jar toppled off the shelf and smashed on the stone floor. 'Yes!' cried the dragonfly. 'Lay still, she's coming back.';
So there I lay surrounded by shattered glass as Mother approached us a second time.;
I thought she was going to step on me but instead she cursed and knelt down. I heard her joints creak.;
'I'LL HAVE TO GET YOU A NEW JAR... OR I COULD JUST EAT YOU NOW! NOT TASTY BUT TEMPTING!';
She smiled and licked her lips. She opened her mouth.;
It does, my friend. Especially if you turn your mind sideways and let what you think you know drain out of your ears.;
Identity confusion seems to feature strongly in your stories.;
Yes, it is a reoccurring theme, but your identity would be confused too if it woke up as an insect.;
Is that a picture of me? What is this place? let us look around.;
As her mouth drew nearer I started to flap my wings, I could not help it, I wanted to escape. Alas, she was too strong and I was too small.;
Suddenly there was a 'BONK!' noise and Mother's jaw went slack. Her muddy eyes rolled back and she collapsed.;
I struggled out from under her hand and saw the dragonfly's jar rolling to a stop near a chair leg.;
'You knocked her out!' I yelled in my mind. 'Yes,' he replied. 'I managed to tip my jar onto her head.';
'Thank you' I said. 'What is your name?' He said 'I cannot remember. I have been a dragonfly too long but there is hope for you.';
He directed me to a near by alchemy table and told me to nibble a bit of this and that. He had the antidote memorized.;
I followed his instructions and soon I felt the worst pins and needles I have ever endured. I passed out and when I awoke I was me again.;
Not as scary as living it, my friend. Do not worry it ends well. Anyway.;
It sounds like Mr Dragonfly tried to get you killed!;
I thought so too, but as it turns out he is quite the strategist. Anyway.;
I rushed over to the dragonfly and opened his jar but he refused to fly out. I heard his voice in my head but it was weaker... distant somehow.;
'It is too late for me,' he said. 'The antidote cannot fix me. I am more dragonfly than man now. Please reseal my jar it brings me comfort.';
I did as I was asked then placed him on a chair while I retrieved my clothes. I then went to the long table where I had eaten.;
'The soup.' said the insect I would later come to think of as Mr Dragonfly. I turned and smiled at him. We were having the same idea.;
I carried the soup pot to where Mother lay, opened her mouth, and splashed some inside.;
'It will take time. Free the others and leave.' said Mr Dragonfly. 'Why can I only hear you inside my head?' I asked.;
He told me that the other insects had been there far longer than him and that they had forgotten how to communicate with words long ago.;
I listened closely to a nearby butterfly. I could hear a faint weeping inside my head nothing more.;
Why didn't Mr Dragonfly's jar smash when it landed?;
His fall to the floor was interrupted by the witches head, mine was not.;
Also, his jar is far sturdier than any other I have seen. I have often wondered if it is enchanted. Anyway.;
Why was there an antidote?;
Mr Dragonfly later told me that he had seen Mother turn her sons into insects as punishment for not doing chores and so on. She was scary. Anyway.;
I opened all the jars then turned to leave and saw a fat moth with grey wings lumbering out of a pile of dirty clothes where Mother had been.;
I scooped her up, sealed her in a jar, then hid her at the back of an ingredients cupboard. I could hear her hissing at me in my mind.;
I turned to Mr Dragonfly. 'Do you want to come with me?' I asked. 'Yes please,' he replied. 'Let us go.';
I grabbed his jar, unlocked the door, and opened it. I found myself face to face with the brothers.;
Briefly being an insect gave you the power to understand them?;
Not just bugs, other animals too. Usually I do not hear very much that is understandable but sometimes I get lucky.;
Mr Dragonfly is the most eloquent by far. Anyway.;
I drew my sword and ran at them. They were so surprised to see me it took a moment for them to realize I was going for the exit not them.;
They shrank back as I rushed past and soon I had reached the hidden door that lead out to the city.;
I pulled a rusty wall-chain and the opening appeared, but before I could get outside the eldest brother jumped on my back and tore open my scars.;
I shook him off, making sure not to drop Mr Dragonfly, then stumbled out into Windhelm.;
I lost my footing and went to the ground. 'Roll!' cried Mr Dragonfly inside my mind. I did and a mace came down smashing a flagstone next to my head.;
The brothers had followed me outside, they each had a weapon and it was clear they wanted me dead.;
Oh no, indeed. Luckily I had surprise on my side.;
Seeing you must have been a shock.;
Yes. Their mouths fell open, their eyebrows went up, and the youngest let out a little whimper.;
I regained my feet and brandished my sword at them. 'Back!' I yelled. 'I will let you live if you walk away.';
'Mother wouldn't turn you back.' said the middle brother. 'What did you do to her?';
'I cured her of her ugliness and put her somewhere safe.' I replied. Townsfolk stopped to see what was happening. We were attracting a crowd.;
I turned to the onlookers and said, 'These men held me against my will, call the guard!' My words were met with stony avidity.;
Then someone threw a bottle at me. The eldest brother shouted, 'This filthy Khajiit broke into our home! He was looking for skooma money no doubt!';
The crowd was getting nasty and as another bottle smashed near my feet I saw two guards at the back of the group turn and walk away.;
'Run!' said Mr Dragonfly inside my head. He did not have to tell me twice.;
Fools! They didn't know who they were messing with.;
I had been through a lot and my body was still recovering from all the transforming it had been doing. I felt slow and weak.;
The brothers didn't have anyone with them?;
No. They had been unsuccessful in their search for another victim.;
The youngest brother took a swipe at me with his sword. I leapt back, overturned a cart of cabbages, and fled.;
I sped past the graveyard into the marketplace and glanced behind me. I had lost most of the crowd but the brothers were still on my tail.;
I rushed through the main gate out onto the bridge. I was exhausted but while my legs had been running Mr Dragonfly's mind had come up with a plan.;
As the brothers stepped out of the gate, panting and furious, I walked out onto the ledge to the left before the first stone arch.;
I sheathed my sword and held out Mr Dragonfly's jar. 'Do you know who this is?' I shouted.;
Why didn't you stand and fight?;
"I was tired and weak; also I did not want to harm the townsfolk. They were mislead. They were stupid, not evil.";
Bloody Windhelm!;
Yes. It is like an ugly, icy cage, where the downtrodden and oppressed must bump shoulders with the apathetic and small-minded.;
'I don't care, all those bugs look the same to me.' replied the middle brother. 'Stay there, you coward! You're a dead man!';
I waited until all three brothers stood near me at the edge. 'Do you love your mother?' I asked.;
'Yes.' sniffed the youngest. 'Tell us where she is and we'll kill you quickly.' said the eldest.;
'Here.' I replied, then I threw Mr Dragonfly off the bridge.;
The brothers all yelled 'No!' and threw themselves over the edge, trying in vain to catch the jar.;
If I had carried out the plan thirty feet along the wall they may have survived, but the icy water they landed in was very shallow.;
There was quite a mess. For a second I was worried about Mr Dragonfly but then I spotted his jar bobbing in the bloody water.;
I made my way down to the river and retrieved him. He thanked me and I asked him again if he wouldn't rather be released.;
'No,' he said. 'I will stay in my jar and in your company if that is OK.';
'I have already forgotten my past life and even the meanings of these words I am saying are beginning to fade.';
I told him he could stay with me for as long as he wished then asked what I should call him.;
You monster!;
It was his idea! I did not enjoy doing such a thing but the plan worked.;
Mr Dragonfly was very brave!;
Yes. I am very proud of him. I think he may have used up the last of his courage in that moment though.;
'Mother scratched my initials on the lid of my jar.' he said. 'I no longer know what they mean.';
'They seem to say Mr D.' I replied. 'Do you mind if I call you Mr Dragonfly?';
He said that was fine. He then said that I would no doubt loose the ability to hear him soon, but so far that has not been the case.;
Ever since my transformation I have been able to randomly pick up his thoughts. I can also sometimes understand horses, fleas, and dogs too.;
Their thoughts are alien and often do not contain words as we know them, but I can usually decipher the overall gist.;
Mr Dragonfly's fear about loosing his words has also not come to pass. I think our little conversations are good for his mind.;
Anyway, that is how Mr Dragonfly and I met. It was a long story. I hope I did not bore you.;
Not at all, Inigo. I enjoyed it. Thank you.;
Good. Mr Dragonfly and I are glad you liked it.;
I am glad you enjoyed it. Telling it was easier than living it, my friend.;
(Yawn) What?! Sorry, I drifted off.;
Do not worry you did not miss much.;
Skip to your transformation if you don't mind. I like that bit.;
Could you start from the bit where you dealt with Mother please?;
Take if from when the brothers followed you back out into Windhelm please.;
Oh no. Here we go.;
(Sniff) That odour, it reminds my nose of Harmugstahl. Interesting.;
Smells like vampires and spiders in here. Maybe vampire spiders? Hmmm.;
(Sniff) That odour, it reminds my nose of Crongvangr Cave. Interesting.;
This place smells magical in a spidery way.;
What was that silly mage trying to accomplish? Skyrim's spiders are fine just the way they are, thank you very much.;
(Cough... Sniff);
Erchhh. What was I drinking last night? Pyechh!;
Kodlak is at peace. We did a good thing here.;
My friend, do you have a moment? I wish to speak to you.;
Dearest Lydia. I hope I never really offended you. I... respected you. I am sorry.;
Remember meeting Kodlak and Vilkas here? It seems like only yesterday. How time flies.;
I remember a little more now. You said 'Hey, Inigo. I bet you that goat would make a lovely steed!' That explains the sore tail.;
Come on, Gleda. I am sorry for my actions last time we met. I now understand you are not short horse. My apologies.;
Witchmist Grove does not ring any bells. I wonder who this person you wooed so quickly is... and if they had a sister. Oh no.;
Gods, you were drunk. You can do better, my friend.;
Hehe. I think it is safe to say you had a little more to drink than me.;
So, we are heading to Morvunskar? I hope the trail of destruction... I mean frivolity, ends there.;
You wanted to get married here? What were you drinking, sanity replant?;
You wanted to get married here? What were we drinking, sanity replant?;
Control yourself, Steed. You can do this.;
Legs, stop complaining! Only another three and a half thousand steps to go.;
Steed, stop complaining. Only another three and a half thousand steps to go.;
Congratulations, legs! You did it! You too feet, you performed well.;
Well done, steed. You are very good at climbing. Those steps did not stand a chance.;
My fleas have returned! I have missed you fellows. How did you end up out here?;
Ow! I am pleased to see you too, fleas but there is no need to be overly affectionate.;
Mr Dragonfly is willing to re-enact his daring drop into the river as long as we promise to go get him again.;
Yes, Mr Dragonfly, this is where it happened. You were very brave. I am proud of you.;
He he he. Silly brothers. We showed them, Mr Dragonfly.;
Mr Dragonfly is wondering if you wouldn't mind running about while you hold him. He is in a playful mood.;
Mr Dragonfly is thinking 'Wooohooo!';
Mr Dragonfly! Look at you go!;
Mr Dragonfly is having a great time!;
I know, Mr Dragonfly! My friend is very fast.;
Mr Dragonfly says thank you for all the fun but he is now starting to feel a bit ill.;
OK, Mr Dragonfly has had enough for now. He is feeling sick.;
Stop it, my friend! You are losing Mr Dragonfly's trust!;
Mr Dragonfly is getting upset! Put him down!;
Mr Dragonfly says he does not want to this again.;
(Cough - Sniff) Urgh.;
(Cough - Sniff);
(Cough) Errrgh.;
Wooooh! Townsfolk, I am a ghost. You cannot see me but I can see you. Behave yourselves. I will be watching. Woooooh!;
Wooooh! Townsfolk, I am the spirit of baked goods. If you value your lives place your sweetrolls over here at the sound of my ghostly voice. Wooooh.;
We are beyond sneaky, my friend.;
Invisibility is reassuring in places like this.;
My nose is certain nothing good ever happened in here.;
Steed, try not to trample my friend.;
Even though it is light I feel weary all of a sudden.;
That strange tree over there is very pretty but its odour is making me drowsy.;
I almost nodded off there.;
Hmmmm. Yum. Sweetrolls are irresistible.;
Hmmm. A delicious sweetroll down the hatch.;
(Sound of eating);
Hmmm. Yum. Yum. Yum. A sweetroll never disappoints.;
(Belches) Sorry, I sometimes eat when I get nervous. Maybe you should take the rest of my sweetrolls away. They are irresistible.;
(Belches) Sorry, I sometimes eat when I get nervous. Do not worry that was my last sweetroll.;
This area makes my steed want to run and run and run. He is wild at heart like me.;
This area makes my steed want to run and run and run. She is wild at heart like me.;
If I had a house here I do not think I would ever grow tired of the view.;
Mr Dragonfly feels pretty safe. He trusts you. That is a big deal.;
Mr Dragonfly is hoping he is in safe hands.;
Mr Dragonfly says you have a good heart. He is in a complementary mood.;
Mr Dragonfly says you and he are alike. He does not remember his childhood either. Who knows maybe you knew each other long ago.;
Mr Dragonfly is glad you had a pleasant childhood. He does not remember his.;
Mr Dragonfly is sad that you had a tough childhood. He wants you to know that if you ever want to talk about it he is a good listener.;
I know, Mr Dragonfly. I am glad I told our friend how we met too. It is good to share.;
Mr Dragonfly, are you OK? Good. Just checking. You do not seem your scintillating self today.;
Mr Dragonfly, do you ever have nightmares about Mother? It would be understandable. I was just asking! You do not need to be so defensive.;
Mr Dragonfly, do you remember anything more about your past yet? Ah well. I wonder who you were. Someone important I bet.;
He he! That is a good one, Mr Dragonfly. You are very funny.;
Rumba dumba dab da dee do, Rumba dumba da da dee do, Rumba dumba da da dee do, Rumba dumba da da da dooh!;
Nda nda nda nda ndah. Nda nda nda nda dadah. Nda nda ndaaa daaah. Dah daaah.;
Mother. Father. Fergus. I hope you are happy and together in the afterlife, and if there is no such thing, I hope you are at peace.;
How much rain does the ground drink a day, I wonder? It cannot seem to get enough.;
The snow smells fresh today. It is a good batch.;
I do not know what I have been told. This place is snowy but I am not cold. I have something to defend. My heart is warm when I'm with my friend.;
I don't know what I've been told. My memory is gone but I'm still bold. I'll kill a spider before I go to bed or he'll kill me and I'll wake up dead.;
I do not know what I have been told. My brain is broken, I am getting old. We are travelling in the Rift. It is getting dark we had better be swift.;
I don't know what you have been told. A friend is worth more than gold. I'd rather be poor with a friend at my side, than be alone and oversupplied.;
It is half way through the day and we are still alive. I hope I can say the same tomorrow.;
How far does a person walk in an average lifetime? How many steps does it take to reach their final destination, I wonder?;
My feet are enjoying all this exercise they are getting. My legs are less enthusiastic.;
Today has been pretty interesting so far. Tomorrow has a lot to live up to.;
The sun may be in bed but a new day is just over the horizon. I cannot wait to meet it.;
I hope the sun is taking a well earned rest. It must be tiring being so bright all the time.;
If the weather stays clear, we may be able to watch the sunrise in a few hours.;
A new day dawns. There is a lot of power and wealth out there, my friend. Let us go claim it.;
It is easy to forget how beautiful the world can be sometimes. What a lovely evening.;
The sky is inspiring.;
Smell that mammoth dung. Pwah.;
This is a place of planning but not very much action. Not yet anyway.;
The smell of freshly cut lumber here is very pleasant.;
I wonder how many trees give their lives everyday so people can be warm and dry. Thank you, trees. We are grateful.;
Even in the dark Skyrim is a wonder to behold.;
Mist at night, predator's delight. Let us try to be ready for anything.;
I feel safe when you are around. It is nice to know that someone capable has my back.;
Be on the look out for nocturnal predators.;
My insomnia is really paying off at the moment.;
I wonder what new excitements the rest of the day has planned for us.;
Everything smells a little wilder when the sun goes down.;
You are very fit. Travelling with you is enjoyable and exhausting.;
I have never been afraid of the dark. In fact, sometimes I think the dark is afraid of me.;
Mind you do not step in a rabbit burrow, they are easy to miss in the dark.;
Mr Dragonfly, do not worry. If we are struck by lightning, I will divert it away from you.;
Hmmm. That was a tasty sweetroll. I wish I had more.;
Hmmm. Yummy. Then goes my last sweetroll. Ah well. I enjoyed our time together.;
What can you tell me about The Doom Strider?;
Not much I'm afraid. Langley is the man to ask about that. All I know is that I am destined to fight whatever or whoever it is.;
I hope you will be at my side when the time comes, my friend.;
It's rubbish! Tosh! It hardly works at all. All it seems to do is give poor Inigo vague directions to the summoner, and a headache.;
Maybe you're doing it wrong.;
I followed the instructions dutifully. There's no reason it shouldn't work. No one knows Inigo better than I do.;
What's that got to do with anything?;
The conjuration mage who created the spell told me that as long as I was Inigo's true friend I should be able to get it to work.;
It's clearly broken. I'm the greatest ally Inigo has.;
You look fairly learned but appearances can be deceptive.;
You look like you may have trouble with some of the bigger words.;
If you want someone to explain information to you that you already have written down, ask Inigo.;
The truth is I don't but let's look at the evidence shall we?;
The fact that Inigo and I have now met and had a chat, suggests the chance that the rest of my vision will come to pass has increased substantially.;
That would have been my prediction.;
Tell me about The Doom Strider.;
I'm horrified by how little I actually know on the subject. I think it's a human, or at least I believe it walks in a human form.;
My dreams and visions are often metaphorical so it's hard to discern exactly what it is, or the nature of the destruction it'll bring.;
What does The Doom Strider look like in your dreams?;
There are two dreams. In both I see a towering, dead minded, red-eyed monstrosity, walking the world leaving sorrow, death, and despair in its wake.;
The very gods are powerless to intervene. In one vision I see them watch in horror as Nirn decays and rots.;
What happens in your other vision?;
That one is a little better. It starts out in much the same way but this time The Champion is there to stop The Doom Strider.;
I see a baby blue khajiit elude death before his first birthday. I see him grow into a great warrior.;
I see him and I talking in earnest, and I see the gods rejoice as he defeats the demon.;
In your vision how does Inigo defeat The Doom Strider?;
That is unclear to me. Perhaps now Inigo and I are known to one another, my dreams will offer up a clearer picture. I'll be sure to keep him posted.;
Your vision of The Doom Strider is metaphorical?;
Yes, I hope so. I'm inclined to believe that the images I see are not literal.;
The destruction I witness could be my mind's way of translating any great catastrophe.;
Perhaps The Doom Strider is an evil man who gains great power, perhaps it's not a man at all.;
Maybe it represents famine or disease, or even a wicked idea that infects every mind it touches.;
That said, considering Inigo is The Champion, and his skill set revolves around killing,;
I think it is more likely that The Doom Strider has a corporeal form.;
What can I tell you about them?;
Where do get your materials?;
Unorthodox but functional.;
I'm a native of Skyrim but I moved to Cyrodiil in my teens. I had a talent for magic and I was packed off to the Imperial City on an apprenticeship.;
Bit of a pyromaniac but a decent sort really.;
He never used his powers against humans, wouldn't hear of it, but he enjoyed burning everything else.;
It's like magic but more reliable. It's all about systematically building knowledge and collecting testable explanations.;
In short, it is the study of everything.;
When did you start receiving visions?;
When I was very young. After I managed to convince people they were real my father called them a gift. Most of the time they're a bloody curse.;
For instance, I knew my mother was going to leave my father before she did.;
It's hard for a nine year old to know what to do with that information.;
I write and I experiment. I research and observe. I spend my days mapping out theories and ideas that strengthen humanity's intellectual grasp.;
I may not be very well known here, but my studies have earned me good standing among certain more rational factions of society.;
I believe a group of Talos worshippers used to live here. I'm not sure where they went but I fear they may have suffered an attack of some sort.;
When I first arrived there were a few collapsed shacks and a destroyed stable too. This is the only building that was intact.;
I needed to re-thatch the roof and fix areas of the walkway but other than that it was in tip top condition.;
Tell me about the items on the shelves by the table.;
They are relics of Inigo's past. The skulls are all that is left of a coven of witches he and his brother destroyed.;
The club belonged to the first giant he killed, and the big helmet at the top was once the property of Browulf the Broad, a fearsome tyrant.;
That one was a near thing but Inigo and Fergus dispatched him in the end.;
The stories behind each item are in the books I gave Inigo.;
Yes. I find that stupidity can be contagious. To maintain one's intellectual prowess it is important to keep one's distance from society as a whole.;
Of course this does not apply to Inigo, and since he likes you so much, I'll suffer your company for as long as he wants you around.;
I will tell you what I know.;
What is the prophecy exactly?;
OK. The Inigo Prophecy. Somewhere out there in the world, there is a very nasty being gathering its strength.;
If left unchecked it will grow until its evil influence burns away all that is good in this world. It has appeared in Langley's dreams for many years;
often as gigantic figure striding through the land leaving nothing but pain, anguish, and death in its wake. He calls it The Doom Strider.;
In the same dream he sometimes sees a handsome blue Khajiit defeat the menace with his help. He calls this fellow The Champion.;
I want to know some details about the information Langley shared with you.;
What can you tell me about The Doom Strider?;
Not much I'm afraid. Langley is the man to ask about that. All I know is that I am destined to fight whatever or whoever it is.;
I hope you will be at my side when the time comes, my friend. Of course I will do my best to keep this from interfering with my debt to you.;
Not much I'm afraid. Langley is the man to ask about that. All I know is that I am destined to fight whatever or whoever it is.;
I hope you will be at my side when the time comes, my friend. Of course I will do my best to keep this from interfering with my debt to you.;
It had better not interfere.;
If Langley's prophecy is correct, everybody will suffer greatly if I do not intervene. That includes you.;
I would rather act with your blessing but if I have to go against your wishes to save thousands of lives, one of them yours, I will.;
It warms my heart to hear you say that, my friend. With your help I know I can finally put some good back into this world.;
Tell me about the books Langley gave you.;
They are called In Search of a Champion and Da Vinci's journal. My father wrote the journal and Langley wrote In Search of a Champion.;
Langley's books contain the story of his search for me and a few tales about Fergus and I.;
The journal is my father's personal account of our upbringing.  In my opinion the books are informative and quite moving.;
What have you learnt about your past.;
Like all Khajiit, my physical characteristics were probably determined by the moons at my birth.;
I seem to be the product of a very rare celestial alignment that only occurs briefly every few hundred years or so.;
In the backward village where I was born a blue child was seen as a bad moon omen.;
I would have been sacrificed if my birth mother had not smuggled Fergus and I away.;
We were not identical but we were twins. Perhaps his life was forfeit by association.;
Whatever the case, I like to think that my birth mother could not bear the idea of separating us.;
If he was your twin why wasn't he blue?;
I can only guess that there was enough time between our births for the moons to shift.;
Langley thinks the alignment that produced me may only last for a few moments. I am incredibly unique, my friend.;
Until we met he couldn't be sure that we ever would. He is understandably relieved.;
Tell me about his search for you.;
Ever since I appeared in his dreams he has been looking for me.;
All he knew in the beginning was that The Champion was Khajiit, avoided death at an early age, and had blue fur.;
He finally heard about a remote village among the shifting sands of Elsweyr;
that ritualistically sacrifices any child born among their number whose fur is blue.;
He set off in search of the village, but on the way he found Riverhold and heard about me.;
He eventually returned here and employed a group of adventurers to continue the search for me and to look for any signs of The Doom Strider.;
He also paid a conjuration mage to concoct a Summon Inigo spell. My mind vibrations were the result of him trying unsuccessfully to use the spell.;
We wait for Langley to receive more information, either from his sources or his dreams. When he hears something new he will let us know.;
He will use the summon spell to vibrate my mind again. My mind is not looking forward to it.;
Langley, I am sure we are great allies in the making, but my friend here and I have a more immediate bond.;
Not that kind of bond. We have travelled together, we have enjoyed sharing our views on many subjects, we have fought bravely side by side.;
Once we're on the path I'll give you the spell and you can try, unsuccessfully, to teleport Inigo to us. Stare vacantly if you understand?;
OK, you can quit the vacant gazing routine now. Come on. We should head outside and get this over with.;
I understand. I am sure it would be wasted on me anyway.;
Yummm.;
I do not think dragon pie likes me very much.;
I am glad I tried it though. Yum.;
I had to pry it open just to read half the incantations. I doubt you'll have better luck.;
Inconceivable! Just you wait, I bet your hands explode when you cast it.;
It feels good. No mind vibrations at all. It is like a brief, warm, embrace followed by a pleasant floaty sensation. There is something else.;
You are a funny fellow, Langley. Poor character judgement, my tail. My friend here did a fantastic job getting the spell to work.;
Note. The subject is clearly delusional.;
You and I are a team. All this moron can do, is collect eggs. How useful is that going to be when we take on The Doom Strider?;
We shall see. I hope you're right. I'm getting cold. I think I'll head inside. Feel free to make yourself at home and stay as long as you like.;
When you leave I'll be sure to contact you with my lesser version of the spell if I hear anything new.;
Thank you, Langley. I am glad we finally met.;
I am too. I can see you're every bit the champion this world needs. I'll see you soon.;
I'm sorry if I spoke out of turn earlier. I'm sure you don't mean to be annoying.;
Apology accepted. Inigo's right. We should try to get along.;
Yes. I agree. Please don't take anything I say to heart. I know I can be insufferable at times. Right. Goodbye for now.;
Being referred to as an idiot is annoying.;
It was just an observation. There's no need to get upset. Look, I'm sorry I called you an idiot. Happy?;
If we're going to work together you're going to have to be more polite.;
I'm going to have to be more polite? Who do you think you are? Just accept my apology and we'll leave it there. Really!;
No. You've been acting like a jealous child! Admit it!;
I will admit no such thing. This is ridiculous. I'm sorry I'm not as perfect as you. I'm sorry I'm passionate. I'm sorry if that upsets you. OK?;
You're rude and petulant. You're the idiot, not me... and your beard's stupid!;
Your brain is stupid! Why Inigo puts up with you I'll never know! They say you can't reason with a fool, well I'm done trying.;
Don't talk to me again until you've calmed down. Goodbye!;
I wanted to knock his block off.;
I do not blame you. He is quite a character, but accepting his apology helped smooth things over, I think.;
He's not that bad really.;
His heart is in the right place I think. I find him quite amusing.;
Anyway. We solved the mystery of my vibrating brain and you got a powerful new spell. A spell they do not teach at any college I'll wager.;
I am still trying to digest everything Langley told me. There is a lot to sort through.;
For now we get on with our lives until he contacts us again. I have a feeling we are at the beginning of a fantastic adventure, my friend.;
For now we get on with our lives until he contacts us again. I have a feeling we are at the beginning of a fantastic adventure, my friend.;
Do not take his words to heart, my friend. It is just his way. He will warm to you in time, I know it.;
I've reconsidered, go ahead and try a bit of dragon pie.;
The next time we are not sneaking, we need to discuss something.;
It feels good to be feeling good again.;
(Cough) Yes, my friend.;
I am not sure we are going to find much in the way of peace and happiness down here.;
You smell powerful, my friend. You are achieving your goals. Congratulations.;
The legend continues to grow. You are achieving your goals. Congratulations.;
My eyes are having trouble taking this place in. It is magical, mysterious, and menacing.;
I found a little loot. Here you go.;
Riverwood smells of lumber, fresh water... and cabbages.;
That is one intimidating mountain!;
Even though this village is between a spooky barrow and a huge menacing mountain, it is quite pleasant.;
This is where Mr Dragonfly's new life truly began. I know you cannot hear him but trust me, he is reminiscing... at length.;
You will have to speak up. I think I have water in my ears.;
I seem to have lost my fleas somewhere. I hope they are all right.;
My eyelids are feeling incredibly heavy for some reason.;
Do you want to relax here for a bit?;
OK. I will do my best to not let this place get to me while you are away.;
OK. Maybe some of Langley's intelligence will rub off on me.;
Thank you. Your hospitality is humbling.;
OK. I hope Langley's grumpiness does not rub off on me.;
Yes. Thank you. I will try to be a good guest.;
Good idea. You should take a break too. You deserve it.;
OK, but I will be watchful. I do not want to become a casualty of magical experimentation.;
OK, but if I start glowing, floating, or transforming relaxation time is over.;
OK. I will case the joint and keep my ears open for profitable information.;
OK, maybe I will work on some new material.;
Why not. Let me know when you are ready to move on.;
OK, I will unwind a while.;
OK, come get me when it is time to go.;
You must be joking. I cannot relax here, my friend.;
This place is not very relaxing. No. I think I will stick with you for now.;
Thank you for the offer but I'd rather not relax at the moment.;
I do not think it is a good idea.;
OK, I will entertain myself until you need me again.;
Let's talk about torches.;
Torches are fantastic.;
What is the bright idea?;
Use a torch whenever you want.;
Put your torch away when we sneak.;
We will be at one with the shadows.;
Never use a torch... Ever.;
OK, I will try hard to be less enlightening.;
OK, but do not blame me if you stub your toe on something.;
Fire away.;
My friend, I do not want to alarm you but you are on fire!;
You are very flammable, my friend.;
My friend, you are on fire... again!;
You are burning again. Stop roasting yourself, my friend.;
Not again! We all accidentally burn ourselves from time to time but you are turning it into a sport.;
My friend, I do not wish to alarm you, but you are on fire! AGAIN!;
On fire again, my friend? I have decided you do it on purpose.;
Yes, yes. You are on fire. Oooohhh. What a surprise.;
Yes, he is on fire again, Mr Dragonfly. Do not worry he hardly seems to feel it.;
Yes, she is on fire again, Mr Dragonfly. Do not worry she hardly seems to feel it.;
Ow! I am hoping I will build up your resistance to fire over time, my friend.;
Ergh! I do not enjoy fire as much as you seem to, my friend.;
Alduin is dead! Yay! We did it! We did it! We did it! He he!;
OK, let us get (Cough) back to it. (Sniff);
You do not have any of my fleas do you? I am getting worried about them.;
I have been thinking. My fleas may have been accidentally washed away when we were swimming the other day. I hope they washed up somewhere safe.;
Hey, fleas? Are you still there? Ow! Yes, they are still there.;
The heavens are getting rid of a lot of water. It is a good thing we are not absorbent.;
Let us find a puddle and do some splashing.;
My boots are filling up with water. I do not mind.;
Just imagine how bloody this land would be if the rain did not clean it from time to time. Thank you, rain.;
That is a lot of skooma you are carrying. I would stick to the dragon souls if I were you. One vice is enough, my friend.;
This skooma I am carrying for you is a terrible burden. Be warned. I am tempted to throw it away.;
Maybe I should drop this skooma I am carrying. It is weighing me down. I do not want to drown.;
This is unsettling but I do not sense danger here.;
That man over there. I saw him during one of my episodes.;
My friend, I have been working on a new song. If you want to hear it let me know next time we are in the Bard's College.;
My friend, I have been working on a new song. If you want to hear it let me know next time we are in the Bard's College.;
My friend, if you ever want to hear me sing one of my songs there is no need to go to the Bard's College any more.;
My confidence is growing. As long as you have somewhere to sit, or we are travelling across Skyrim, any safe area will do.;
I think you should disown that steed of yours.;
OK. I never really owned my steed anyway. I think we both knew it was going to be a temporary partnership.;
Fair enough. I hope they do not take this personally.;
Fair enough. I hope they do not take this rejection to heart.;
My friend, Do you mind if I ask you something?;
Not right now. I have a lot on my mind at the moment.;
I understand. It can wait. Now, where were we?;
Langley is a very interesting man. He knows a lot about me and there is a great deal of evidence that his visions usually come to pass.;
All that said, we have only just met him. In your heart of hearts, do you think we can trust him?;
Yes. I honestly believe he is trying to do good.;
I feel the same way. He has many flaws, but who doesn't? Even though we have just met, he has been a part of my life for years.;
He is a good man. Hearing your opinion has eased my mind. Thank you, my friend.;
I'm not sure. I wouldn't be surprised if he has other motives for helping us.;
It is hard to tell what those other motives could be. I want to believe he is our ally, but your opinion is important to me.;
I do think that he is mostly good but perhaps we should be wary just in case. I appreciate your insight, my friend.;
There is something else I am compelled to mention.;
When you were out getting those eggs, I told Langley about how you spared my life and my debt to you. He questioned my memory.;
He said my mind has been through a lot with the skooma, the grief, and the endless battles and so on.;
He suggested that maybe you are not the person I remember.;
That's ridiculous! We have a past together! I just don't remember much of it.;
I know! That is what I told him! You are my friend to the end. Langley may know a lot but he does not know everything.;
Inigo, I've been meaning to talk to you about that...;
What does Langley know anyway? He does not know you like I do. He does not know about our shared past. No, I will not entertain such a silly idea.;
I am not confused. I would know you anywhere. You are my friend. End of story.;
He is just jealous of our friendship. Pay it no mind. Anyway, that is all I wanted to say. Let us talk of other things.;
Are they images from your visions?;
Yes. I discovered my love of art in the Imperial City. Now I mainly use my talents to depict what I see in my dreams.;
I paint them as soon as I wake up. I find that locking a dream in place in the form of a picture often lends further insight.;
Can you tell me my future?;
I'm afraid it doesn't work like that. Whenever I try to force a prediction the results are usually extremely vague.;
My more accurate visions come to me in the form of dreams. Though even then they show possibilities, not definite outcomes.;
Have you had any dreams about me?;
No. Not yet anyway. I occasionally get flashes of Mr Dragonfly but that probably doesn't mean very much.;
Over time Inigo's fascination with the little fellow has obviously seeped into my dreams.;
I wouldn't feel too left out though. If you have a place in all this I'm sure you'll show up eventually.;
So. Had any good visions lately?;
There was something.;
I saw a woman reading your future. A bit ironic. Anyway, she isn't very talented or engaging. I don't know why you bother visiting her to be honest.;
I saw you at a fancy party. You aren't going to be there for long but I think you're going to leave quite an impression.;
If you go don't drink too much, and you may want to watch out for trolls.;
I saw you discovering a great magical artefact, by mistake of course. It's large, and round, and extremely dangerous in the wrong hands.;
I saw you at the top of a very high mountain talking with a dragon. I'm afraid I woke up before the beast ate you...;
or maybe you killed it. I can't be sure.;
I saw you and a hairy man fight off an army of undead. And I saw you locking yourself behind a door by mistake. Very amusing.;
I saw you wandering in a dense fog surrounded by the vagrant dead. A great roaring filled the air.;
It wasn't very pleasant.  If I were you, I'd cancel any plans and stay indoors for a while.;
I saw you terrifying the town of Whiterun. You were not yourself. You were unrecognizable and very angry.;
I saw a lot of fire and death. Kill the crazy jester or don't. Either way woe betides you.;
I saw you exterminating skeevers. Watch out. Their master is rather more dangerous than they are.;
I saw you fighting off a group of dangerous glowing beings in Winterhold. I'm guessing you're probably the cause of this calamity somehow.;
I saw you being lead astray but someone you work with. In my dream you end up paralysed.;
I did see you meet a very interesting lady later though, so it's not all bad.;
I saw you fighting the thinnest dragon you'll ever meet. He may look menacing but he's really quite brittle.;
I saw you in a falmer infested cave. Then engaged in battle around a giant statue of some sort. The eyes of the statue looked very valuable.;
I saw you at a wedding, but as usual you were up to no good. Shoddy masonry is your friend, the guards of Solitude are not.;
I saw you preparing a meal for a very important person. They are not who they appear to be.;
It's a good thing too considering your cooking ability.;
I saw you on a boat talking with the Emperor. Can't imagine why he'd want to talk to you.;
I saw you leading the College of Winterhold. More of a nightmare than a dream to be honest.;
I saw you retrieve a powerful green sword for a big strong woman. Watch what you say around her though. She doesn't like thieves.;
I saw you having a wail of a time with a strange man. You were both very drunk. A goat is involved somehow and a giant.;
Maybe it was I giant goat. I can't remember.;
I saw you talking about cheese with a confused and bearded man. There was something about having to aim at those who aren't fighting. Perplexing.;
I saw you talking to a dog and the dog talking back. Good to know you're going to find someone who can communicate at your level.;
I saw you and Inigo in a large waterlogged cave surrounded by spiders. Inigo, at least, is going to enjoy himself.;
I saw you and Inigo fighting a group of angry people. People who are no longer in full possession of their minds.;
I saw you and Inigo on a boat... half way up a mountain. The boat is far less interesting than what's beneath it.;
I can be quite excitable.;
About your fighting style...;
I am versatile.;
My fighting is very stylish.;
Is there a new plan of action?;
I am adaptable.;
Fight however you choose.;
Yes. Inigo Style is the best style.;
OK. I will do what comes naturally.;
OK. Our enemies will fall by blade and by bow.;
Yes. It is probably for the best.;
Favour the blade. Get in close if possible.;
OK. Things are going to get messy.;
OK. I will get up close and personal.;
OK. I will meet our foes face to face.;
Favour the bow. Use ranged attacks whenever you can.;
OK. I will try to stay out of trouble while I cause as much mayhem as possible.;
OK. I will endeavour to lend support from a distance.;
OK. Killing from a distance is often safer and less messy.;
All right.;
Woah! That was a bumpy one! Where are we, my friend? This place smells exciting.;
Woah! Who needs an invitation when you have teleportation? Good to see you, my friend.;
I have moved, but I am still waiting.;
I will now wait over here.;
Was that a little farewell teleportation or do you need me?;
Woah! Did you see that, children? I appeared out of nowhere! It is a good trick, yes? Hey! They are not even paying attention.;
Ta da! What did you think of that, children? These children must have seen a lot in their short time. They are hard to impress!;
Shazam! Amazing yes? ...No? Let us not waste any more magic here, my friend. These youngsters are jaded.;
Hello, my friend. I guess I will do my best to relax here for a while. This place is making me nervous though.;
I am here and luckily for you I had just stopped urinating.;
He he. Anyone who just saw me teleport across the room has probably had too much to drink.;
Being summoned is wonderful, but I cannot fully enjoy the sensation knowing that you are wounded.;
It is hard for me to enjoy being summoned when you are hurt, my friend.;
Teleportation is not fun when I know that you are in pain.;
Langley is ignoring our amazingness. It is his loss.;
He he! Langley, did you see that? ...He is not impressed.;
Hello, my friend. Do you want to join me for a stroll or are we going on another adventure?;
Good to see you. If you want me to join you just say the word.;
Ah. There you are. I thought I had lost you.;
Teleportation can be relaxing.;
He he... Now, what was I doing?;
Hey! You interrupted my relaxation. I do not mind. Being summoned is pleasant way to be interrupted.;
Hey! You told me I could relax, then you summoned me here. What is the big idea? Let me know if we are moving on.;
Woah! Hello, my friend. I suppose I am relaxing here now? Let me know if there is a change of plan.;
I felt like a furry bolt of lightning that time.;
Teleportation is warming.;
Woah. Oops. I almost slipped on re-entry.;
I am faster than any snowball!;
Teleportation is snow joke! He he... That was terrible. I will never say it again.;
That felt ice! He hee... No? Not funny? OK, I apologize.;
(Sneezes) My nose teleported around some pesky snowflakes.;
I am dry! Now I am getting wet again.;
I was so quick I didn't even make a splash.;
That was a soggy teleportation.;
Teleporting in the rain is now one of my favourite hobbies.;
Being summoned in this wet weather feels spectacular.;
Silly rain drops, you are not as speedy as me.;
Teleportation is a wonderful way to clear the rainwater from your ears.;
Worry not, good townsfolk. This magic is perfectly safe... in the right hands.;
Ha ha! Now for my next trick I will juggle my fleas. Maybe not. They would never let me hear the end of it.;
Tell your children. Tell your children's children. You witnessed Inigo the amazing teleporting Khajiit. He he.;
Believe your eyes, people. You are not having an episode.;
This is the most fun I have ever had in Windhelm!;
We are showing off.;
People here may want to re-examine their knowledge of summoning after seeing us in action.;
You cannot learn this spell. You either have it or you don't.;
There is little point in locking me away.;
No prison can hold me for long.;
Oh. I am still here... unfortunately.;
I was hoping I would appear outside this place.;

Ha he he he. (Coughs) Ah.;
He he. That felt funny.;
He he he. That tickled.;
That felt good.;
Alakazam.;
That was disconbobulating, in a good way.;
Am I glowing? No. Only on the inside.;
Mr Dragonfly is confused by his whereabouts.;
(Burps) I teleported some extra air with me. Sorry.;
I feel like I have just had a massage.;
I almost lost my fleas that time.;
Nothing like a teleportation to get the circulation going again.;
I feel lighter. I think I left my last meal behind.;
I must be the fastest man alive.;
You summoned me?;
I enjoy teleportation very much.;
Where did I go? Oh, here I am.;
I feel magical.;
I love this spell!;
Mr Dragonfly wishes he did not need me to teleport. Dream on, Mr Dragonfly.;
You, my friend, are very talented.;
That spell may be the most powerful weapon you will ever own.;
I wonder how we ever did without that spell. It is practical.;
Hey! Where did you go?;
I do not think Langley enjoys watching teleportation. Maybe we should cut it out for a bit.;
Use it, my friend, do not abuse it.;
I thought I was leaving. This is good exercise.;
I guess I'll be doing more walking than I planned.;
This is getting old.;
Do you need me or not. Make up your mind please.;
(Sighs);
Together again.;
You look like you have something else to say...;
They say that dragons have returned to Skyrim. The Helgen attack does not bode well.;
I wonder if the Jarl of Whiterun knows he has giant lizard problem. If not, he may reward us for the information.;
Are you feeling OK? You took that dragon's soul. It did not look or smell natural, my friend. If that happened to me I would no doubt soil myself.;
The horn we are after had better be worth it. This place is unpleasant.;
So, we are going to Sky Haven Temple. Alduin's Wall sounds very informative. I wonder if there is an Inigo's Wall anywhere.;
The leader of the Grey Beards is a dragon?! I did not see that coming.;
If we discover that Delphine has already taken the Elder Scroll and replaced it with a note, I may have to hurt her.;
While I cannot count the number of ways this plan could fail, I am certain that you will succeed. This is going to be interesting.;
He he! Look at that silly gas bag. I bet he is feeling very embarrassed at the moment.;
You are really going to ride that beast, eh? You continue to be the most impressive and reckless person I know.;
Let us find Paarthurnax. I cannot wait to meet him. I bet he has a very inspiring beard.;
Good luck, my friend. I will see you when the party is over.;
Let us go kill a dragon!;
Now is a time for diplomacy. Try to keep the shouting to a minimum. Good luck, my friend.;
Fly well, my friend. I wish you all the luck in the world... Not that you need it.;
Travel safe, my friend. My heart goes with you.;
Good luck with Alduin. I will see you on the other side.;
We need to go to this Bleak Falls Barrow place to find the Dragonstone, eh? I hope it not a horrible crypt full of zombies.;
We should probably drop that Dragonstone off in Whiterun as soon as possible. I have a horrible feeling it attracts the undead.;
The Jarl is going to be very happy with you. Killing that dragon deserves a reward I reckon. Maybe ask for your weight in sweetrolls.;
Congratulations on becoming a Thane, my friend. You wear the title well.;
I hope the Greybeards are welcoming. They sound like they could be a stern bunch.;
The Greybeards have taught you well and you are a quick learner. Now you are louder and faster than ever. Let us go get that horn, my friend.;
I am glad you finally got that horn. Those Greybeards had better grateful.;
Let us go to Kynesgrove and end that dragon. Maybe then Delphine will give you some real answers. I hope she is trustworthy.;
If I were a dragon you would terrify me. Anyway, Delphine is a Blade, eh? She does not seem that sharp to me.;
I thought the Thalmor were just a bunch of intolerant snappy dressers. I wonder why they are involved in this dragon business.;
Remember, we do not know much about this Malborn fellow you have to meet. We should be watchful.;
You talk to Malborn. I will keep an eye out for Thalmor spies.;
That party was not a success but at least you did not get dressed up for nothing. We should get back to Delphine and share what you discovered.;
Esbern sounds like a useful ally. It looks like we are going back to Riften, my friend.;
I hope we find Esbern before the Thalmor do.;
Let us get Esbern out of here... Alive if possible.;
I wonder what this new shout you need to learn does exactly. Maybe it turns dragons into sweetrolls. Devastating and embarrassing.;
Your new shout is pretty amazing. I have never met anyone who can control the weather before. You are impressive and practical.;
I hope that dragon did not eat Paarthurnax.;
We are looking for an Elder Scroll, yes? If I see one I will let you know.;
This place smells mischievous. If I were an Elder Scroll I think I would like it here.;
Another skooma addled moron. Let us move on. These brothers are making me remember things I would rather forget.;
You got the Elder Scroll! Well done, my friend.;
Let us get that Elder Scroll to Paarthurnax. I think he is going to be very impressed you found it.;
So, you have attained full Dragonborn status. Being shouted at by a group of old men has never been so rewarding.;
Time for you to go to a party, yes? Do not have too much fun without me.;
I suppose we should go to the Sleeping Giant and find out who has taken the horn. They are a real time-waster whoever they are.;
Well, that was rather anticlimactic. If we are done wasting time let us get out of this place.;
Ready for a little dragon slaying, my friend?;
I cannot wait to reach the Western Watchtower and meet this dragon! I wonder what it is going to smell like.;
That was exhilarating! I think Alduin will think twice before messing with you again. What a battle!;
On top of everything else you now have to organize a truce between the Imperials and the Stormcloaks? This could be difficult.;
Are you ready for negotiations? I am honoured to present at such a historic occasion.;
Truce accomplished. Well played, my friend. Now, let us go trap a dragon.;
I fear that soon you must go where I cannot. I am neither the Dragonborn or a dead Nord. Have fun saving the world, OK?;
I wonder if Alduin knows you are coming for his stinky head. It matters not. He will lose it either way.;
This crypt smells lively. We should be on our guard.;
Alduin is dead! Sweetrolls for everyone. Well done, my friend! This dream just gets better and better!;
You look very fancy, my friend.;
OK, we have the Dragonstone. Let us get out of here now please.;
I do not like the smell of this place. Let us just find that Dragonstone and get out of here.;
Intriguing.;
This is worst party I have been to in a while.;
I can smell magic and death, but no horns so far.;
I cannot wait to see this horn. It must be a magnificent thing to behold.;
This tomb is very interesting in an ominous way.;
I wonder if the horn is made of gold. I bet it is very pretty.;
I wonder how valuable the horn is. Maybe the Greybeards will let you keep it. We deserve a reward for suffering this place.;
Stupid tomb full of stupid zombies and no stupid horn at the end of it all. What a waste of time.;
Somewhere deep below us an Elder Scroll is waiting. I can almost smell it.;
If I were an Elder Scroll where would I be hiding? Probably somewhere warmer.;
I hope the Elder Scroll is safe. This place smells hazardous.;
I have a feeling that the Elder Scroll is just one of many secrets down here. This expedition could be profitable.;
I wonder the Elder Scroll feels starved of attention down here. I do not think many of the locals can read.;
Smell that scroll. Elder.;
The smell of dragons and death is strong here. Phwa.;
I hope this was not a one way trip.;
You have met your match, Alduin!;
Let us get this party started!;
Hey, Alduin! My name is Inigo and I do not fear you!;
You look even uglier than you smell, you flying fiend!;
Bring him down, my friend!;
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!;
Brenda the Bear? Dragon Pie? My Heart is in the Rift?;
A Friend in Time? Silly Spider?;
Silly Spider?;
I think that is it for now.;
I'd like to hear A Friend in Time if you don't mind.;
This one is just for you. I've slipped a thousand times, my friend. I slid a slide that rarely ends.;
I've hurt those who healed me. I've neglected those who needed me.;
I was steeped in lies and sad goodbyes. Every day I wished for my demise.;
I didn't want to be me. I couldn't bear to see me.;
Then you came along and freed me.;
So thank you with all my heart, my friend. I now have something worthy to defend.;
My nose can smell, my eyes can see, that you gave me back who I can be.;
I'll follow you through all you do. When you cannot walk I will carry you.;
Know that I am always here for you. You cast away my past and made me new.;
If I die now it will be for you.;
My dear friend, tried and true.;
That is it. I mean ever word.;
You stink of skooma!;
Alduin is dead!;
My friend, you are amazing. You saved us all. You killed that smelly world-eater and put an end to his maniacal machinations.;
My friend, you are amazing. You saved us all. You killed that smelly world-eater and put an end to his maniacal machinations.;
Alduin is dead!;
My friend, you are amazing. You saved us all. You killed that smelly world-eater and put an end to his maniacal machinations.;
I had the strangest dream that I was there fighting Alduin by your side. It was very exciting. A shame it was not real.;
Anyway, well done. If they do not build a massive statue in your honour I would complain.;
You WERE there with me, Inigo!;
I thought it was a dream! Wow! That is the best news I have had in a while! That means we both saved the world from Alduin.;
I know you did most of the work but what an adventure! I really thought I had just imagined the whole thing.;
Thank you for putting me straight. We are quite a team!;
I wish you could have been there.;
That is nice of you to say. Do not worry, I am sure there are many adventures in our future that we can both be a part of.;
Congratulations. You are a hero of the highest order.;
It was a job for the Dragonborn and the Dragonborn alone!;
Of course. I would not want to steal your thunder. It was a wonderful dream though.;
Alduin is dead!;
My friend, you are amazing. You saved us all. You killed that smelly world-eater and put an end to his maniacal machinations.;
Are you alright, Inigo?;
My mind is on the past today. Sorry if I seem a little distracted.;
Yes. I am relaxing.;
Yes. I am pretty good at the moment.;
Yes. I think so. Thank you for asking.;
Anything I can help you with?;
I think you deserve a bit of relaxation.;
If you ever need a pick-me-up just let me know.;
I am missing my brother, that is all.;
How are you, Langley?;
I am OK, really.;
OK, I suppose. Happy you're here.;
When you found him, you buried him somewhere nice, yes?;
I am happy I am here too.;
Do I not look OK?;
On the way to Skingrad there's a ruined archway near a place called Greenmead Cave.;
I carried Fergus through the archway into the forest beyond. I laid him to rest in a quiet clearing away from the road.;
If there's anything you need give me a shout.;
You look fine but you've been through a lot. I'm concerned. That's all.;
A quiet green place. Yes. Good. He would have liked that.;
I will, thank you.;
Do not worry about me, Langley. I am as healthy as a horse.;
I hope he's at peace. When I found him he still looked vital and strong. Remarkable really.;
Well, I'll let you get back to your writing.;
Well, I'll let you get back to your cooking.;
Well, I'll let you get back to your alchemy practice.;
Well, I'll let you get back to whatever it is you're doing.;
That does not surprise me. He was always a bit of a poser. You know, he never had any fleas. Thank you for taking care of him.;
My pleasure, Inigo. My pleasure.;
Do you ever feel mistreated, Inigo?;
I'm feeling a bit sleepy. I think I'll go to bed soon.;
Inigo, think of a colour. Hold it in your mind. Wait... it's coming... wait... It's blue!;
You don't have Thunder and Lightning, I see?;
So, tell me about your friend.;
Only by myself.;
OK, Langley. Peasant dreams. I will try to stay quiet.;
That was amazing! You saw right into my mind! You are very magical!;
Sorry. I am afraid it was green.;
No. I am afraid I sold them. I regretted it straight away.;
He is wise, handsome, and good in a fight.;
She is wise, beautiful, and good in a fight.;
Oh, don't worry about me. I can sleep through anything.;
That wasn't magic, dear boy. That was pure intelligence. As you were.;
Blast! That would have been my second choice. Ah well.;
That's a shame. Who knows? Maybe they'll find their way back to you one day. Stranger things have happened.;
Hmmm. Maybe I should ask you again when we're alone.;
I'm not in the mood anymore. I seem to be easily distracted at the moment.;
Maybe I will. I doubt I will be able to improve things though. It smells pretty fantastic already.;
So you get more visions?;
Oh. I see. I will let you get on with it then.;
That happens to me too. I was going to ask you something else but now question eludes me.;
Thank you, Inigo. I am quite a practised chef.;
That's the idea. A little alcohol doesn't hurt either.;
I'm sure it'll come back to you. Being easily distracted is a sign of intelligence. Don't be too hard on yourself.;
I can tell.;
I know. My nose told me so.;
How much do you drink a day if you do not mind me asking?;
Not enough.;
What are you wearing, Inigo?;
Nothing. This is all me.;
My friend picked it out. I do not enjoy it very much.;
Nice isn't it?;
Just a little something my friend gave me.;
Aren't you cold?;
How barbaric. You should wear what you want. Really!;
Yes. You look very dashing indeed.;
Ah, interesting.;
Sometimes, but not often. Luckily my fur is quite weather resistant.;
It's not so bad. There are worse things than looking like an idiot.;
I generally defer to my friend on all things fashion related. They have better taste than I do.;
If I went out like that I'd probably die of embarrassment before the cold got me.;
Very true. Looking like a fool is far better than actually being one.;
I seem to get paint on everything I wear.;
Yes, well you look nice. Good job, Inigo's friend.;
Langley. That picture of me... bleeding, when did you paint it?;
Quite some time ago. I had a horrible dream where you nearly died. There was a crazed wizard, chickens, and the undead.;
Can you tell me what happened?;
Maybe I will share the whole story another time, but the short version goes like this.;
I found myself in the clutches of an evil man, the wizard you saw, deep in a crypt. He wanted to turn me into a chicken.;
Oh dear. Sounds dreadful.;
I broke through a door and escaped but fled right into a large group of zombies. They gave me these scars.;
I was thinking. Is it possible that the evil wizard could be the Doom Strider? He said that hate made him stronger.;
Hmm. Interesting. It's possible I suppose... but unlikely.;
Well, in my dream I saw the wizard being ripped apart by several undead.;
My guess is that after you got out of there, the remaining zombies went after him.;
Good deal. That fellow had it coming.;
I can't be sure that's what happened, but it certainly seemed that way.;
I hope so. Ah well. It was just an idea.;
It was a good one, Inigo. If you think of anything else let me know.;
So you hired a group of adventurers to search for me?;
Your paintings are very unique, in a good way.;
Yes, a useless bunch really. They haven't come back with anything yet.;
I've sent out word that you've turned up and that they should now focus on The Doom Strider.;
Thank you. I like to think so.;
I hope they find out something soon. I am eager to know what it is I will be facing.;
Maybe one day you could paint a picture of the three of us saving the world.;
Whatever it is I'm certain we can handle it together.;
Unfortunately I think I could only fit two of us onto a sheet.;
My friend and I will do whatever it takes. With your help I am sure we will be unstoppable.;
Well, you could always put my friend and I on one sheet and you on another, then hang them side by side.;
Yes, Langley Longseer, The Champion, and Dragonbum. A mighty combination.;
Yes, Langley Longseer, The Champion, and The Egg Fetcher. A mighty combination.;
Well, I'm eager to witness what they are capable of. I meant no offence.;
Inigo, has your friend had some kind of accident? Why do they keep crouching?;
My friend is just staying limber. Do not worry.;
Oh, they seem fine now. Good.;
Dragon souls smell bad to me. I will distract my nose with a song. I will find a tune and then some words...;
My friend floated right beside me. Asked me to sing a song. I tried to think of clever words...;
It was late at night. I tried to wake up a song. I found a tune and then some words...;
It was a starry night. I wrote the stars a song. I hope they enjoy my choice of words...;
Soon a new day will dawn. Why not greet it with a song? I awoke a tune and then some words...;
It was a lovely day. My friend wanted to hear a song. I found a tune and then some words...;
It was a nice damp day. A day that deserved a song. I found a tune and then some words...;
It was pretty cold, I warmed myself with a song. I tried to think of cosy words...;
My friend stood looking at me. Asked me to sing a song. I tried to think of clever words...;
I, myself, and me joined to sing a song. We opened our mouth and released some words...;
My friend is similar to me. We both enjoy a song. I will try to improvise some words...;
My friend asked a favour of me. 'Would you make up a song?' I found a tune and then some words...;
Oh, you are gone. Luckily you never disappear for long.;
My friend swam away and I splashed along.;
You unleashed your beast, try to howl along.;
You picked out a beat and I sang along.;
My friend mounted up and I followed along.;
Arrows are pointy and sharp and long.;
I see a pretty light and I follow along.;
The rain drummed the ground and I sang along.;
The snow fell down as we moved along.;
Run on ice and you will slip before long.;
My friend ran off and I followed along.;
I wondered if we would be standing here long.;
Do not expect them to last long.;
It is hard to find phrases that get along.;
Wherever you are heading I will tag along.;
Sweetrolls are tasty they never last long.;
It may be hard to sing a long.;
I hope I find more as I go along.;
The sun is setting it is easy to see, the sky is lovely, as lovely as can be.;
The sun is rising, lighting up everywhere. Soon the stars be sleeping, who really knows where?;
We rode our steeds, heading I know not where. The smell of a steed is sometimes hard to bear.;
My friend backed away heading somewhere. Hopefully not into the mouth of a bear.;
Keep your eyes in front, there is ice everywhere. If you slide and fall I will try not to stare.;
You drew your bow aiming somewhere. Do not shoot me, shoot over there.;
Your hands are full of magic I see. Burn our foes, do not burn me.;
Your hands are full of magic I see. It'll be hard to sing if you freeze me.;
Your hands are full of magic I see. I wonder where you'll teleport me.;
You are busy hitting the ground. Until you are done I will hang around.;
You are making a meal. It is plain to see you are a better chef than me.;
That light is beautiful it is plain to see, wherever it goes I will be.;
We did not move or go anywhere. Just standing around is hard to bear.;
We stood and thought, and pondered where... Thoughts begin. Ermm... my mind is bare.;
We seek an adventure I know not where. We'll end a dragon and kill a bear.;
You know I will follow you anywhere. I will maim your boredom and kill your despair.;
I hope my singing is going somewhere. I'll sing over here and I'll sing over there.;
What are you doing, have you lost your mind? Maybe put that down, we have adventure to find.;
Our steeds are faithful and strong and kind. They may be dim but I do not mind.;
You are a dog with a big bushy tail. If you do not feed you whimper and wail.;
I am hard to see but I do not mind. My heart is invisible but it knows you are kind.;
My ears are wet but I do not mind. Let us take a dip and see what we find.;
These lyrics may appear a bit unrefined. I am busy trying not to fall behind.;
You are straining your eyes and your mind. Shoot that bow before you go blind.;
Spells are useful they train the mind, but in the wrong hands they can make you blind.;
It is dark but I do not mind. I'd sing to the stars if I were blind.;
Good morning. Good morning. Let the day unwind. Let's do some exploring and see what we find.;
What a lovely day to bear in mind, what we have lost and left behind.;
My friend brings me joy and peace of mind. He is fierce, and brave, and wonderfully kind.;
My friend brings me joy and peace of mind. She is fierce, and brave, and wonderfully kind.;
I hate hate and being unkind. Beauty is a state of mind.;
What are you thinking, what is on your mind? I have heard certain thoughts can make you go blind.;
I was a prisoner of my mind. You unlocked my thoughts, they are unconfined.;
I like singing what springs to mind. When I am singing I feel unconfined.;
Watch your back, do take care. Mining is strenuous, please beware.;
My nose can smell you it is aware, but I cannot see you, only thin air.;
Your magic is powerful I am aware, it smells pretty good I do declare.;
Your magic is flashy I am aware, but magic can hurt please take care.;
Watch where you are going, please beware. Do not step in a rabbit burrow do take care.;
Archery is fun I do declare, but arrows are dangerous please take care.;
I enjoy the dark my nose is aware, the night smells exciting I do declare.;
The sun is down but I do not care. When it is dark I feel more aware.;
I am naked and enjoying the air. If people are offended I do not care.;
We are naked and enjoying the air. If people are offended I do not care.;
My armour is heavy, it helps me take care. It'll stop an arrow better than a prayer.;
My armour is light I do declare. It does not chafe or impair.;
Armour is nice but I am aware, that putting armour on a steed is a little unfair.;
We are ready for battle attack if you dare. We will end your life then give your ghost a scare.;
When I'm with you I am floating on air. Now my heart has a reason to care.;
This is nice I do declare. I love being out in the open air.;
This land is pure, smell that air. I love this land, I do declare.;
While we are swimming we should take care. Some fish have huge teeth, we should beware.;
I'm plucking these words out of thin air. They are hard to catch I am starting to despair.;
Travelling with a friend is never a chore. My friend is big and menacing but easy to adore.;
We are in the Rift, a place I adore. I really don't think I could love the Rift more.;
I can smell smells that are hard to ignore. Your cooking is easy for my nose to adore.;
Your hands hold a power I cannot ignore. Being set on fire is quite a chore.;
Your hands hold a power I cannot ignore. Being frozen stiff is quite a chore.;
Your hands hold a power I cannot ignore. Being electrocuted is quite a chore.;
Your hands hold a power I cannot ignore. Teleporting about is never a chore.;
I'll ride and sing and sing some more. My steed finds this song hard to ignore.;
When we are floating I wonder what is in store. Carnivorous fish are hard to ignore.;
I am running and singing and singing some more. I do not find running or singing a chore.;
We are standing and wondering what is in store. I do not mind standing but I like moving more.;
We are a team you cannot ignore. We are hard to kill but easy to adore.;
Travelling with a friend is never a chore. We will stick together no matter what is in store.;
Travelling with a friend is never a chore. Times with my friend are times I adore.;
I open my heart just like a door. My heart is tender it has been through a war.;
I am glad I am well, my throat is no longer sore.;
Being hit by an arrow is really quite sore...;
My steed is not fazed by the sight of gore...;
I do love the rain and how it does pour...;
The snow is nice but what is it for?;
Working on a farm must really bore...;
Look. There is a boat that has run ashore.;
Running is tiring but my feet are not sore...;
My mind is a land without a shore...;
Crongvangr Cave was a fun cave to explore.;
Your proving was an adventure, of that I'm quite sure.;
Getting drunk with a daedric prince made my head sore.;
I will never forget the first time I heard a dragon roar.;
These words are making my throat sore...;
If you pull my tail you will hear me roar...;
I wonder if I am beginning to bore...;
Where are you, my friend? Please do not be invisible anymore.;
I love beautiful sunsets, I wish they would show up more.;
You are bouncing up and down. Do you need help or should I sing more?;
You are working hard collecting lots of ore.;
Are you making health potions? We could always use some more.;
Small towns are nice but they sometimes make me snore.;
We are getting clean, maybe we should swim more.;
Enchanted spiders are interesting but I like normal spiders more.;
Thanks to us Alduin will not be bothering anyone anymore.;
I do not like sinking, I enjoy floating more.;
This song makes no sense and yet there is more.;
You drink a lot of blood, but you always want some more.;
Mr Dragonfly is snoozing, I can hear him snore.;
Music is in me, in every hair and every pore.;
This tune is rather random. It may make you snore.;
The smell of a dragon soul is unreal. When you absorb one how does it feel?;
Aim an arrow into the sky. If it meets a bird both will cease to fly.;
You are gone, I hope you were real. Being able to see you would be ideal.;
This mist is making the land seem unreal. My eyes enjoy it, but it is not ideal.;
The stars are cold fire scratched in the sky. Their beauty makes me want to cry.;
The sun is ruling over the sky. I will never be that bright no matter how hard I try.;
Aim an arrow into the sky. When if falls down watch it does not hit you in the eye.;
Raindrops are falling from the sky. One just fell into my eye.;
Snow is falling from the sky. I will never be that graceful no matter how hard I try.;
Life really is a funny old deal. It is everything bad, good, and surreal.;
Being with you is sometimes surreal, but being your friend is a really good deal.;
Sometimes I cannot say what I feel. I do not know which words I should reveal.;
Shoot your enemy in the brain, if they still move shoot them again.;
Any ore you find is yours to claim. Digging can be fun when you turn it into a game.;
You are not a pet and you are not tame. You smell pretty doggy but you are not to blame.;
I am more than a man with a broken brain. I am not a pet and I am not tame.;
We are getting wet it not a shame. Weather like this makes travelling a game.;
Our steeds are silly but not to blame. They are always happy unless they are lame.;
Open your mind, do not feel ashamed, show your sorrow and show your pain.;
Empathy is good, good for the brain. One man's pleasure is another man's pain.;
You hate spiders that is a shame. Playing with spiders is my favourite game.;
We enjoy hitting spiders in the brain. Spiders maybe fun but they are not tame.;
I enjoy hitting spiders in the brain. Playing with spiders is my favourite game.;
I know loss and I know shame. Life may be fun but it is no game.;
My mind is not fast but I have killer aim. I will defend you fit or lame.;
I own my sorrow it is mine to claim. If I do not like me I am to blame.;
Mist is damp it is true, I find it refreshing how about you?;
You gave me this steed I sit upon. You ushered my life into the light of dawn.;
Horses are beautiful it is true. I am sure they think the same about me and you.;
Running can be tiring, it is true, but running feels good when I am running with you.;
Relaxing is good, it is true, but I would rather be out adventuring with you.;
I was happy trapping that dragon, it is true, but I was sad saying goodbye to you.;
We have some regrets, it is true, but it is the future that matters when I am with you.;
You have no regrets, it is true. I wish that I was more like you.;
You say you are bad but that is not true. Very few people are as nice as you.;
You are my friend, tried and true. Just say the word and I will die for you.;
You saved us all from big ugly lizard. You collected eggs in a blizzard.;
You have a spell that strengthens our connection. You took my life and performed a resurrection.;
I am strange it is true, but life is stranger when I am near you.;
I like this, travelling with you. We have each other's backs it is true.;
I am a weapon that you unleashed. I am a sword that you unsheathed.;
Thank you very much for setting me free. Of course I mean metaphorically.;
Thank you very much for setting me free. My steed thinks you're great, we agree.;
Thank you very much for setting me free. Swimming with you I am as happy as can be.;
You are going backwards I can see, do not walk off a cliff or hit a tree.;
Standing about is fine by me. When my body rests my mind is free.;
Thank you very much for setting me free. I may have to cut this short I really need to pee.;
I really, really wish sweetrolls were free. A lack of sweetrolls is bothering me.;
You called me a freak, I say I am free. I know what you mean, I am as happy as can be.;
Thank you very much for setting me free. Now I really know who I can be.;
Thank you very much for setting me free. Our friendship is stronger than an oak tree.;
Thank you very much for setting me free. Mr Dragonfly is happy just like me.;
Thank you very much for setting me free. Travelling with you I'm as happy as can be.;
Thank you very much for setting me free. Standing by your side I'm as happy as can be.;
Why are you jumping? I hope it is for joy. I am running out of words to deploy.;
I wonder why you are moving that about. Life is a mystery there is no doubt.;
You are very fast, look at you go. Mind you do not fall down in the snow.;
We are a team I hope you are alright. Mind you do not trip, try to stay upright.;
You are a champion tough and brave. When you are not mining, you are filling graves.;
We are both champions tough and brave. While you are busy I will try to behave.;
Remembering our adventures brings me joy. Maybe there is another world-eater to destroy.;
We are both champions tough and brave. Watch those spells, try to behave.;
We are both champions tough and brave. If you fight us you are digging your own grave.;
We are both champions tough and brave. We went to a party, we didn't behave.;
We are both champions tough and brave. We are pretty hairy but we never shave.;
We are both champions tough and brave. Searching for excitement and people to save.;
The stars are very pretty, I wish they would stay. I must enjoy them before they go away.;
This foggy weather is a feast for the eyes... as if the land is wearing a disguise.;
My steed is happy that we are together. Just like me my steed enjoys this weather.;
You are chopping wood, don't get a splinter in your eye. If you do don't worry, you probably won't die.;
My steed is happy that we are a team. If we see a zombie my steed will not scream.;
We are travelling across Skyrim. This land is pretty, lovely, and grim.;
When I shoot my bow I always aim for the eyes. Anything I hit usually dies.;
When I swing my sword our enemies pay. If I were my enemy I would run away.;
I wonder why the snow wants to cover everything. Where does snow go when it is spring?;
I hope that we survive this night. I hope I meet a spider and give it a fright.;
I wonder what adventures we will find tonight. I hope a zombie doesn't give me a fright.;
You are standing close you smell a little ill. I hope it is not affecting your skill.;
You are standing close, you smell fit and well. Health is a thing you cannot buy or sell.;
My voice is running out of things to say. I search for words but they run away.;
There is more ore in the ground than words in my head. I regret I must soon put this song to bed.;
I am sorry to see you seem distracted. Maybe my song is too protracted.;
There are more stars in the sky than words in my head. This song is getting tired, it must go to bed.;
There are more fish in the water than words in my brain. Soon I will run out, I must end this refrain.;
There is more rain in the air than words in my head. I regret I must soon put this song to bed.;
There is more snow in the air than words between my ears. This song must soon end, please hold back your tears.;
This is the song I made up for you. It may not be pretty but it is still true.;
There are more smells in the air than words in my head. I regret I must soon put this song to bed.;
This is a song I made on the fly. If it is no good you know the reason why.;
You asked me to make up a song. I hope you do not think it is too long.;
The song is almost over, it is true, but I will always have another song ready for you.;
Singing for you is a pleasure, my friend, but I am sorry to say this song must soon end.;
You are big and hairy and scary I must say. I think you are scaring my words away.;
I wish my steed would sing instead. But the idea of singing fills my steed with dread.;
Riding is enjoyable I really must say, but for now my words have galloped away.;
Maybe you could dig up some words for me. My mind is depleted it is plain to see.;
Maybe you could cook up some words for me. My mind is famished it is plain to see.;
Now how do I finish this tune I found? Damn it. I wish I were profound.;
I am a blue abomination, what can I say. Maybe I scared all my words away.;
It is time to finish this tune I found. I wish my words would stick around.;
I hate infested lighthouses I really must say. The last one we visited scared my happiness away.;
Singing is fun I really must say. A shame that words sometimes go away.;
Maybe one day you will sing for me. My mind is growing empty it is plain to see.;
I really thought I had more to say. All my thoughts, they went away.;
You are a beast most would see chained, but I hope that you were entertained.;
You are leaping about and I have ascertained, that maybe you are not entertained.;
You are amusing yourself, you are unrestrained. You do not need a song to be entertained.;
We are swimming and my lungs are strained. I hope we do not drown, and that you were entertained.;
We are swimming and my lungs are strained. I hope I do not drown, and that you were entertained.;
We are running and my voice is strained, but I hope that you were entertained.;
Dum diddly dum diddly dum de de. Diddly dom da de do da daaaaah.;
That is that my mind is drained, but I hope that you were entertained.;
This was tiring I feel a bit drained. I hope that you were entertained.;
The end.;
We are trying to be stealthy. I had better shut my mouth if we want to stay healthy.;
All of sudden we seem to be sneaking. I will shut my mouth, it should not be speaking.;
I fear that there is danger near by. I will close my mouth and open my eyes.;
There may be trouble in this area. I will stop singing to limit hysteria.;
This place does not smell safe to me. For now I will be quiet and leave this song be.;
We seem to be crouching I should stay quiet. I do not wish to start a riot.;
I do not want too many strangers listening to me. I will stop improvising and leave this song be.;
This place does not put me in a singing mood. I am afraid that this song must conclude.;
Could you follow closer please?;
Of course. Moving up.;
Yes. It was lonely back there.;
I smell danger near by. The song will have to wait.;
There never was such a silly spider. A spider came to town last night. The spider was angry he wanted a fight.;
This one is just for you. I've slipped a thousand times, my friend. I slid a slide that rarely ends.;
This place could be dangerous. I will leave the song for now.;
This place could be dangerous. I will leave the song for now.;
He wasn't too bright, set himself alight a burning spider is quite a sight.;
People gathered to watch him burn and still Mr Spider refused to learn. There never was such a silly spider.;
Silly, silly, silly, silly, spider. There never was such a silly spider.;
The spider came to town this morning. He wanted to shop and do some exploring.;
He frightened a girl, made her hurl, the guards let him off with a warning. People chased and he did run, silly spider thought it was fun.;
There never was such a silly spider.;
Silly, silly, silly, silly, spider. There never was such a silly spider.;
The spider came to town today. He told the townsfolk he wanted to play.;
They ran him through, made spider brew, then wrote this song I am singing to you.;
Silly spider did not stand a chance, people gathered to sing and to dance. There never was such a silly spider.;
Silly, silly, silly, silly, spider. There never was such a silly spider. The end.;
This place could be dangerous. I will leave the song for now.;
I've hurt those who healed me. I've neglected those who needed me.;
I was steeped in lies and sad goodbyes. Every day I wished for my demise.;
I didn't want to be me. I couldn't bear to see me.;
Then you came along and freed me.;
So thank you with all my heart, my friend. I now have something worthy to defend.;
My nose can smell, my eyes can see, that you gave me back who I can be.;
I'll follow you through all you do. When you cannot walk I will carry you.;
Know that I am always here for you. You cast away my past and made me new.;
If I die now it will be for you.;
My dear friend, tried and true.;
I smell danger near by. The song will have to wait.;
An improvised song would be nice.;
I usually prefer more educated surroundings. This is no Bard's College, my friend.;
That place helps me focus my talent for some reason.;
But, I suppose I could try to think of something.;
Fair enough, I will give it my best shot.;
I will see what I can come up with.;
A song would be nice from time to time. Thank you, Inigo.;
No problem. I find a song can sometimes make a long journey less gruelling.;
Erm... Maybe you should leave the singing to the professionals.;
You are probably right. My voice is unmusical. If you change your mind though, just say the word.;
If I happen to be performing while we are on the move, I will stop if we are being sneaky.;
I will also cease to sing if we find ourselves somewhere potentially dangerous, or densely populated.;
Entertaining in public while you are seated is one thing, singing while I frantically chase you through a city is quite another.;
An improvised song would be nice.;
Fair enough, I will give it my best shot.;
I will see what I can come up with.;
An improvised song... Erm.;
I have been working on a few songs of my own. If you want to hear them take a seat and let me know.;
I not mind standing or sitting while I perform, but I would prefer that you were relaxed and focused.;
Would you sing Dragon Pie please?;
I am not sure it is the best idea considering who could be listening, but fair enough.;
Brenda the Bear if you don't mind.;
My Heart is in the Rift?;
We are in the Rift. That song is unnecessary at the moment. I could not sing it with conviction. How about something else?;
A good choice. Here we go.;
Silly Spider!;
OK. Singing that one is always a pleasure. (Clears throat);
I'd like to hear A Friend in Time please.;
Actually... I'm not in the mood any more.;
If you do not mind, when we have a moment I would like to discuss something with you. Remind me when we are seated somewhere safe.;
Langley's house would be a bad idea though. What I want to discuss concerns him.;
If you do not mind, when we have a moment I would like to discuss something with you. Remind me when we are seated somewhere safe.;
If you do not mind, when we have a moment I would like to discuss something with you. Remind me when we are seated somewhere safe.;
Why don't you just tell me now?;
And be rudely interrupted by a wolf attack or some such? No. It can wait.;
Where would you like to talk?;
Any peaceful area with a place for us both to sit will do.;
An inn or a home would be preferable, but as long as we are not in danger I really do not mind where we talk.;
OK. We'll rest our legs and have a chat soon.;
Good. It is not a pressing issue, just something I would like to hear your opinion on.;
My eyes say thank you for the beauty they behold.;
That is quite a sight.;
Look at that, Mala. Beautiful.;
Wow. Look at this, Charles.;
Wow. Quite a sight eh, Paxton?;
Leonidas, look at that. Wow.;
What a wonderful view.;
I am in awe.;
Wow. Look at this, Mr Dragonfly.;
Hey, Mr Dragonfly. You need to see this. It is amazing.;
Mr Dragonfly thinks this is an impressive sight.;
I'm sorry for your loss, Inigo.;
That means a great deal. Thank you.;
What were your parents like?;
I suppose they were a bit of an odd couple being an argonian and a khajiit, but they adored each other, and us.;
Despite their previous profession they were good people.;
What kind of jobs did you do?;
A bit of giant killing here, a bit of witch slaying there. We took gold when it was offered but sometimes we worked for nothing.;
It is hard to deny those in need, whether they have coin or not. We made more than enough from those who could pay anyway.;
Where did your travels take you?;
All over Cyrodiil, from the Gold Coast to the Jerall Mountains. It is a wonderful land but quite tame compared to Skyrim.;
Those were happy times - travelling or working during the day, camping out under the stars at night. Life was good.;
I'm sorry. Losing your brother like that must have been terrible.;
Yes. That morning I lost all that was dear to me. Unfortunately I also uncovered a side of myself I never knew existed.;
Do you ever wish you had stayed and fought?;
Every day, my friend. Every day.;
I thought I did. We dulled each other's pain somewhat. She seemed like the only bright thing in a very dark place.;
Regrettably she was a vicious manipulative harpy.;
Do you ever miss skooma?;
From time to time my body does, but my mind is made up, I am never touching the stuff again.;
It helped me smother some painful memories, but it took my sense and reason as payment. It was not a fair trade.;
There is not much to tell. He never spoke about his past but it was clear he had also been through a great deal before becoming a bandit.;
That life did not seem to suit him. He had been an educated man at some point, I am sure of it.;
He was violent but he had retained some dim vestige honour. I wish we had met under different circumstances.;
So your brother was called Fergus? That's interesting.;
Our parents enjoyed unusual names.;
Sounds similar to someone I know.;
Lydia. I think you are smarter than you let on.;
You've got no idea.;
Yes. It is true. I think you deserve a sweetroll for putting up with me.;
What have you got in your hand there? It looks like a toenail.;
Let us put it to the test. How does a battle of wits sound?;
This is part of me guard it with your life.;
How does a knife in the guts sound?;
It IS a toenail! Errm... I appreciate the gesture, really I do, but you hold onto it for now.;
I would like to see you try it. You would probably miss and hurt yourself.;
All right.;
Talk about crazy. Wow.;
How dare I? You just threatened me. Not so smart after all.;
Hello, Lydia. We have not been properly introduced yet. My name is Inigo.;
Over here. I am the blue thing talking to you.;
The blue thing? Oh, hi. It's very nice to meet you.;
Likewise. Are you feeling OK? You seem distracted.;
Emmm. What we talking about?;
I was just saying you seem a bit distracted.;
I am. I've got some fresh cabbage. I'm thinking of making some apple-cabbage stew.;
Errr. OK. I will leave you to your thoughts.;
I hope her sword arm works better than her head. Geesh.;
I sometimes wonder if any zombies wander out of their tombs at night. If you hear groaning let me know.;
If you hear any groaning that is not Lydia, let me know.;
That is pretty authentic.;
Lydia, you are very good at making zombie noises.;
Lydia, how about we catch a mudcrab for dinner?;
Why not? Mudcrabs are tasty. Better than bread anyway.;
I think you are confusing mudcrabs with something else.;
Hey, Lydia. Do you ever wonder if...;
Lydia, I am concerned about the state of your mind. Maybe you need more rest.;
Lydia. What is worse in your mind, an evil chicken or an evil rabbit?;
A delicate question to be sure. It's not really a fair comparison if you ask me.;
That sounds interesting but it is not relevant to the current conversation. See, this is what I am talking about.;
You are right. They are equally terrible in their own way.;
If you say so. I think you might be sick.;
If you saw what I have seen you would not trust chickens or rabbits either, believe me.;
I do not understand. Are you trying to break my brain?;
Hey. I am being serious. I may be crazy but I am not mad.;
Of course, sweety.;
Hey! (Sigh) Nevermind.;
Lydia, I have some bad news about our friend.;
That must have been someone else. I am sorry for your loss but try to stay focused. Our friend is not going to die but he is ill.;
That must have been someone else. I am sorry for your loss but try to stay focused. Our friend is not going to die but she is ill.;
Do you have a cure disease potion by any chance?;
That is NOT a cure disease potion, that is an eyelash. We need a potion that cures disease.;
No, I don't think you do. Ah well.;
That would be dangerous. It is pretty cold. If we were to rest now we would no doubt all have to lie close together to conserve warmth... Hmmm.;
You're pretty, I'll give you that.;
I find the concept of sleeping with you not only repulsive but morally unsettling.;
Woah! I do not mean what you think I mean. You are pretty but I do not find you attractive in that way, Lydia. I am sorry.;
Is it so hard to believe? We are adventuring companions, that is enough.;
There is no need to be sorry. (Yawns) Now I am getting weary.;
Lydia, be careful down here. One wrong move and it could be your last.;
Still with us, Lydia?;
Are you alright, Lydia?;
No setting off traps for fun, OK?;
Try not die down here, Lydia. I would miss you.;
This place is making my hair stand up.;
My nose is telling my brain to get out of here.;
Lydia, you are doing well. Keep up the good work.;
I am glad you are down here with us, Lydia. Do not take my jokes to heart. You are worthy companion.;
I am. Thank you.;
Aah! Don't do that!;
I am sure you can. Just try to be watchful, OK?;
Never fear. We will protect each other.;
Thank you, Lydia. I will be all right.;
Sorry. I think I scared myself more than you to be honest.;
No. It is just food for thought.;
Lydia, I am curious, do you ever think about... things? In general, I mean.;
Lydia, how is your thinking coming along?;
Can't do that.;
Sure you can. Just focus until some thoughts appear. Go on, give it a try.;
Yes you can. You are brighter than you imagine. Let us try again.;
You can do it. I believe in you.;
So... any new thoughts?;
Ah, well. Do not be discouraged, it takes practice. Keep at it.;
Perhaps that is enough for now. Do not strain yourself. Maybe we can try again later.;
Do not worry about it. My thoughts often dry up too. It happens to the best of us.;
Really? In what way?;
You're bloated with disease.;
I am not. I am as healthy as a horse. How rude. How would you feel if someone said that about you?;
Exactly. Please try to be more polite in future.;
Lydia, you may enjoy this joke. What is the difference between a knitting needle and a piece of giant's poop?;
He he he. That is not the answer I heard, but it is pretty funny. Good job.;
No you are not, Lydia. Glance down and you will see your feet, I assure you.;
Here we go again. No you are not, Lydia. Glance down and you will see your feet, I assure you.;
Are your feet still there?;
Crisis over.;
Me me me me. Pardon me. Just warming up. Never know when I may called upon for a ballad.;
I would like to request a song about... Err, let's see... Bottoms.;
Ba ba ba bum bum, ba ba ba bum ba bum. Ba ba ba bum bum, ba ba ba bum ba bum. Da dum.;
Hello, Mjoll. My name is Inigo.;
It is not common in these parts, I grant you. To be honest though, I have not met that many people called Mjoll either.;
Where does that come from?;
I don't know really.;
Well, it is a very beautiful name. It suits you.;
Another gorgeous grey day.;
Indeed. Who knows, perhaps it will rain later.;
I certainly hope so.;
You, Mjoll, are a woman after my own heart.;
Mjoll, what do you think about the walking dead?;
Urgh. They reek of decay. Sometimes I just like to watch them burn.;
Yes. From a distance though.;
Ow! Mjoll! Did you just pull my tail?;
Is it bleeding?;
Na, I don't think so.;
Why would you do such a thing? You are very strong.;
That I am.;
There is no need to sound so happy about it.;
Sorry. How is the pain? Any better?;
A little. Do not do that again please.;
Easy for you to say. Ow.;
In the jar? Oh that is Mr Dragonfly. He is a big fan of yours.;
In the jar? I introduced you already. That is Mr Dragonfly. He is a big fan of yours.;
No. He is a vital part of the team.;
Why are you laughing? You are acting crazy, Mjoll. Do not worry, Mr Dragonfly does not hold it against you.;
By the gods, you're serious.;
Always looking on the bright side aren't you.;
I hope so. What else would it be? I am quite hairy all over.;
I'm sure that's true. Kind of scary if I think about it.;
Yes, I think you may have said that already.;
You're not sweet talking your way out of this.;
Yes. You are a rational woman who knows when I am joking. You understand the importance of harmless humour in such troubled times.;
How can I argue with that?;
You can't. I meant no offence, Mjoll. Forgive me.;
Well, maybe just this once.;
It seems that there are less spiders roaming the land these days.;
That is understandable, but annoying.;
I don't like the looks of this place.;
Indeed. Always safe, never sorry.;
We are in this together, Mjoll. Never fear. We will protect each other.;
You are not helping my nerves, Mjoll.;
Of course. My friend and I enjoy having you around. Now, let us focus on the task at hand.;
I am alert, Mjoll. Do not worry, I am very alert.;
Mjoll. What do you think about my fur... the colour I mean?;
Does it bother you that I am so different?;
No, my friend. You and I are alike. We seek challenge and great fortune.;
I was right about you. You are as smart as you are strong.;
Keep your eyes open for ambushes.;
Good idea, Mjoll. Ambushes are the most dangerous type of bushes by far.;
Is that so?;
You are incredibly bloodthirsty today. Maybe you should take a few deep breaths.;
When are we going to see some action?;
Very soon, no doubt. Until then I think I will try to stay out of your way.;
Agreed.;
Yes. It is a wonderful place, that is for sure.;
Now aren't you a strange one.;
We are, and it is, but the snow and ice only serve to highlight the warmth we feel for those we care about. It is not so bad.;
Hmm. I had not thought of it that way. Fortune smiles upon this meeting.;
I hope so. Good to have you with us.;
If anyone sneaks up us I'll smell them coming... or I might not. We will see.;
So what you are saying is that you may, or may not know if someone is creeping towards us.;
You are taking us somewhere warm I trust?;
Do not worry. In time you will grow a thicker coat of fur, like me. Look at my tail for instance.;
Mainly prolonged exposure to the elements. That and a healthy diet. Eventually you will be warmer.;
Good. Not too many of those out here, but imagine if we had our weapons stolen just before a dragon attack. That would be bad.;
I am guessing you are pretty speedy.;
Well, so am I. In fact, I believe I may be a little faster than you.;
Let us hope we never need to find out.;
That is probably because we kill every nasty thing we see.;
Hairballs giving you trouble?;
Do not look at me. I smell fantastic. (Sniffing) You smell pretty good as well.;
(Sniffing) That is the truth. We are fortunate.;
My friend, maybe you stood in something odoursome. Perhaps we should run through a stream the next chance we get.;
Why you! Hmph!;
I am a little tired it is true. I am sure we will rest soon enough.;
I wish that I had your optimism.;
Hey, Kharjo. I happen to have two sweetrolls here.;
Ah, this is good.;
Do you want one?;
Both.;
There are two sweetrolls and two of us. That is a sweetroll each. Would you like one of them?;
No. Both.;
But then I would have none.;
I think I will keep them stored away for now. They seem to bring out the worst in people.;
(Sniffing) Hmmmmmm.;
Kharjo! Stop sniffing my sweetrolls! Control yourself.;
Today has been interesting. I wonder what tomorrow has in store for us.;
You are probably right. We lead a charmed life.;
Speak for yourself. I find this weather pleasant.;
I have always been strange.;
What seems to be the problem?;
Need me some skooma.;
Really? If I see you using that rubbish I will throw you in a river. I am disappointed in you.;
This again! You have a problem! If I see you using that rubbish I will throw you in a river. I am disappointed in you.;
No need to get so hostile.;
I respect you, Kharjo but do not pollute your body on our time. We need you with your senses intact. Do you wish to be a burden?;
Good. You are better than that. No skooma.;
A word of advice my friend, do not mix gambling and drink.;
Good advice. Let me return the favour. Never fall in love with a bear.;
That is right, do not even think about it. You clearly know what I am talking about.;
Hmmm mmm. I understand.;
Maybe you should move about more and complain less. It is just a suggestion.;
I am pleased to meet you. My name is Inigo.;
Err, no. Magic and I have a troubled and messy past. I will leave that side of things to you.;
Excellent. I think you will be glad you made this decision.;
Do you have much skill with a bow and sword? Those are my strengths.;
In truth I do not.;
Well, together I am sure our talents will prove mutually beneficial.;
J'zargo, I can smell the magic in your veins. You are talented.;
Yes, I know just what you mean.;
J'zargo will be successful. Of this there is no doubt.;
And modest too. I think you will go far in this life. I am sure you agree.;
That is a good attitude to have but I suppose you can never really be certain.;
I meant no offence. You are indeed a great mage.;
Yes, I think we do.;
J'zargo. I seem to have disposed of those sweetrolls you gave me earlier.;
You... You have? Already?;
Yes. I have eaten every last one.;
You what?! But how could you run out? J'zargo gave you more than enough!;
Maybe you could magic up a few more.;
Ah well.;
J'zargo, do you ever fear failure?;
Never ever?;
Never ever... ever?;
Control yourself!;
Never ever, ever, ever?;
You are saying you have never been afraid that you will fail... ever? I am not sure I believe that.;
Lots of things. Not all of us are as perfect as you.;
It is certainly one version of the truth. Other opinions are available.;
J'zargo, I am pretty sure I heard you break wind while you were casting a flame spell some time ago. Was this intentional?;
Eh, no. That was not supposed to happen.;
I think you should do it more often.;
Too much magic can be dangerous.;
I guess that goes double for magic combined with gas.;
I know where to find such an individual.;
Stand at the edge of any still pool of water and look down. The person staring back up at you is who you are after.;
How can I argue with that?;
It would be out of character that is for sure.;
It is nice having you with us, J'zargo.;
What do you hope to get out of our time adventuring together?  If you do not mind me asking.;
J'zargo hopes to find things that will make him a more powerful mage.;
Like goat vomit?;
I heard that rubbing goat vomit into your hands can make spells more potent.;
No, I don't believe those rumours, my friend.;
Maybe we should try it out. I will capture a goat, put my fingers down his throat, and then you...;
Skyrim was not J'zargo's first choice.;
Really? There are many talented mages here. I can see why it would be a good place to train.;
J'zargo can learn magic from these men and elves but they cannot learn to be as dashing as he.;
You are very sure of yourself, J'zargo, but I do enjoy your company.;
You are arrogant and amusing.;
Humble and depressing?;
I am in a spider squishing mood. Tell me if you see any.;
I will keep an eye out.;
J'zargo, have you had any trouble from the local population since you arrived here? Racism I mean.;
They look upon us and see only thieves and smugglers.;
Sad but true. Many people here are backward morons. We should not let them define us. They are not qualified.;
I am interested, how would you define us?;
Yes. That is a preferable generalization. I like it.;
J'zargo. Fancy a wager?;
I bet I defeat more enemies than you do toady.;
Well, J'zargo is surprised and pleased. There is a real competition here.;
The looser owes the winner ten sweetrolls, OK?;
I can almost taste them.;
Mr Dragonfly finds you interesting, J'zargo.;
Mr Dragonfly is the little fellow spinning about inside this jar I am carrying.;
Mr Dragonfly is the little fellow spinning about inside this jar I am carrying. I thought I introduced you already.;
What does it do?;
Him not it. He does not do much to be honest, but he is full of wise words and supportive advice.;
I doubt it. Magic has not been his friend. We are similar in that regard.;
This is disappointing. Once you are done with it, perhaps you will allow J'zargo borrow it.;
I think Mr Dragonfly would rather stay with me. He finds your spells intimidating.;
It is intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lighting is it not?;
Well, I can tell you that I am not very receptive to the force of lightning.;
No. Please, keep your spells under control.;
I know what you mean.;
Hey there doggy. Is everything OK?;
Yes, faithful hound. Do you have something to say?;
How are doing my furry friend?;
If you are good maybe I will let you chase me later. I am afraid we are busy at the moment.;
Stop complaining. You are not a puppy any more. The rain is good for you. Try to enjoy it.;
Well, I think this weather is a blessing. Someone could use a bath.;
I like you too, you big smelly lump. Now, let us try to stay focused.;
Easy for you to say. You have twice as many legs as I do.;
How can you be cold with all that lovely fur of yours? I think you are just seeking attention.;
We are not the same. When I like a tree I want to climb it. When you like a tree...Well, we all know what happens. It is not pleasant.;
I do not wag my tail for anyone. Do not take it personally.;
I know. I can smell it too. In fact I thought you were the culprit.;
How is that relevant to anything? Sometimes I wonder if you understand a word I am saying.;
Shutting up.;
We will talk later. Now we must be quiet.;
Shhhh.;
Stay quiet.;
Trouble near by. The song will have to wait.;
I smell danger. Shutting up for now.;
The song is over. We have trouble.;
This place smells troublesome. I will stop singing for now.;
I am sorry. I am no longer in a singing mood. Maybe later.;
Keep a hold of yourself. You will not die down here.;
J'zargo. Your fur is standing up. Are you OK?;
My mind does that too. Stupid mind.;
Nothing nice, that is for sure.;
Well, let us hope that is all we find. I can smell death.;
No? I wish that I had your optimism.;
J'zargo, don't go practising your magic here please.;
Like anyone would even notice in all this mess.;
How rude.;
Lydia, I hope you are enjoying your time with us.;
I am. I have a good thing going here. This family, this band it's the best thing I've ever been a part of.;
That is very sweet of you to say. I know I sometimes joke around but I do value your company. You are an asset to the team.;
So, Angi. Are you seeing anyone at the moment? It is probably none of my business.;
That's right, it isn't.;
You enjoy archery, yes? Maybe we could go hunting together sometime.;
Go on. You never know, it could be fun.;
I think she likes me.;
He is hiding something. He smells nervous.;
I'm not hiding anything.;
Maybe somebody stole your ring, Mjoll.;
A good question. Perhaps we should all turn out our pockets.;
I am sure you don't.;
Let us search him.;
I may have just misplaced it somewhere in the city.;
Maybe. You do not want us to search him?;
Yes, Lady Mjoll?;
That was awkward.;
Aerin, why are you here exactly? Maybe it is time you gave Mjoll some space.;
That's not going to happen. Mjoll's brought me nothing but safety and peace of mind.;
I am sure that is true but she has her own life to lead. Don't you have somewhere else to go?;
Anywhere that is not here.;
I don't have to take that from you!;
I am just saying that you following her about like a lost puppy is a bit weird. It is odd behaviour.;
Call them! You are essentially trespassing on private property!;
Now you're being ridiculous.;
Summon the guard then. I dare you.;
And yet you have still not called the guards. Interesting.;
So, Langley wants you to move in with him?;
Yes... When we are not adventuring together, of course. Do you think would be a wise move?;
The next time we part ways I will return to his cabin. This is going to be interesting.;
You living with Langley could be a good idea, for a while at least.;
I know we have our reservations about him but his cause is mine also. I suppose it makes sense.;
Agreed. His cause is mine also. Maybe we will make more progress if we are living together.;
Move in with me, Inigo.;
You are kind but I must refuse. You are a busy individual and at this stage I feel my free time should be spent sorting out my own affairs.;
Either I stay in my cell or I live with Langley. For now at least, those are my options.;
I don't think moving in with Langley is a good idea.;
You are probably right. Things are fine the way they are.;
Let me think about it. I'll get back to you on that.;
I am also uncertain. Let me know if you form an opinion.;
Inigo, I've been thinking. When you're not out adventuring with your friend where do you stay?;
I have a place in Riften. It is a bit cramped but it is dry and it often smells interesting.;
Well, if you ever want to come and stay with me you're more than welcome. It could be beneficial to our cause.;
That is very kind of you but I do not wish to intrude.;
You wouldn't be intruding at all. If you decide to move in I'll make you a sleeping area. There's no shortage of timber around here.;
Thank you for the offer. I will certainly consider it.;
Good. I'll consider making some renovations then.;
I have a few lockpicks if you need more, my friend.;
Remember, I have some extra lockpicks if you need them.;
We need to find more lockpicks. Soon.;
That was nail-biting. Well done.;
It is a good thing you have steady hands.;
I think you held that lockpick together though sheer force of will.;
I was not sure you were going to crack that one. I should not have doubted you. I am sorry.;
I would frame that lockpick, my friend. It has done well.;
Nicely done. Phew.;
Who needs talent when you have the Skeleton Key, right?;
Good job. Using the Skeleton Key does not require much skill though. Watch you do not go rusty.;
You have a gift, my friend. I am sure the Skeleton Key helps a little too.;
You have a gift, my friend... and a lot of lockpicks to fall back on.;
He he. Skill is the best key.;
Your fingers are talented.;
What a professional.;
That was some fine lockpicking, my friend.;
Skilfully handled.;
You never seem to break a lockpick. You are a marvel.;
Here you go, my friend.;
I hope it is useful.;
I will bear that in mind.;
Oh, hey. You have been gone a while. I thought I would relax until you were done. Are we moving on?;
You left me waiting for you. I am glad you are alright. I looked about for a bit but I could not find you, so I decided to head home.;
You left me waiting. I stood for a long time but you did not return. Good to see you are alright, but you could have told me where you were.;
You left me behind again. After a long time I realized you had probably continued on your way without me, so I headed for home.;
You abandoned me again. You are forgetful.;
You left me waiting... again.;
Once again you left me waiting and did not return. I had no idea I was so forgettable.;
You left me waiting in a dangerous area. I did not know where you were. To be honest I did not know where I was.;
It is good to see you are alright. I was worried.;
You left me waiting in a hostile place, my friend. I searched everywhere for you but you were gone. I am relieved you are OK.;
You abandoned me in a dangerous area again. I waited as long as I dared then began tracking you. Luckily my nose did not let me down.;
You left me waiting again. You keep leaving me in places where everyone and everything wants me dead. I am not amused.;
You abandoned me again! Do not ask me to wait somewhere you have no intention of returning to.;
You left me waiting during our last adventure. It is not the first time this has happened. If you want to travel alone just tell me.;
Do you realize you left me waiting in a place infested with zombies? Not a pleasant experience. I am glad you are OK but I am not happy.;
Why did you leave me waiting in that horrible place, my friend? There were zombies and bad smells. If it was some sort of joke it was not funny.;
You left me waiting at a spooky crypt again. I am starting to think you dislike me. I was attacked several times while you were gone.;
Please, my friend, the next time we are in a zombie infested area try not to forget about me.;
I cannot believe you left me in a draugr crypt again! If you ask me to wait in such a place in future maybe I will refuse. You are absent minded.;
You left me waiting in a draugr crypt again. That is no way to treat a friend.;
I think we were interrupted earlier when we were talking about my map.;
Yes. How is it working out for you? Pretty fantastic eh?;
I'm sorry, Inigo.;
That is alright. Some spiders found me soon after you left. It was not so bad.;
Apology accepted.;
Ah well, no harm done.;
OK. What is done is done. In my heart I know you did not mean to leave me.;
Actions speak louder than words, but I accept your apology.;
Yes... well, just try not to do it again please.;
OK. If you mean that, do not leave me behind again please.;
OK. Do not worry. I am used to it by now.;
It wasn't my fault.;
I believe you. Sometimes things have a way of just happening. I do not blame you.;
Well, you certainly do lead a busy life. No harm done.;
I understand. Mr Dragonfly kept me company. It could have been worse.;
You have said that a few times now. I will give you the benefit of the doubt.;
You are in control of your actions, are you not? Never mind.;
That excuse is getting old.;
Anyway, shall I join you again?;
Anyway, let us get back to it.;
Whistle and I will come to you, my friend.;
OK. Hang on. With you in a moment.;
Time to go, eh? OK.;
We are heading out? All right.;
On my way. Ughhh. I have pins and needles.;
OK. Relaxation can wait. Let us go.;
(Yawns) Huh? Oh.;
Oh. Sorry. On my way.;
Sorry. I was daydreaming a little.;
Hmm? Oh. Moving out.;
I was lost in thought. My apologies.;
OK. I'm Coming!;
Hold on! I am on my way!;
With you in a moment!;
On my way.;
OK. Where are we going now?;
Moving out.;
I will attack on sight.;
I will give in to my violent tendencies.;
I will let my aggression rule me.;
OK. I will be more aggressive.;
Throwing caution to the wind.;
Fighting when I choose.;
Attacking when I feel the need.;
Ready to fight.;
Claws out.;
OK. I will try not to start any trouble.;
I will endeavour to be less aggressive.;
I will attempt to control my temper.;
I will try to be unaggressive.;
Regaining composure.;
Exercising restraint.;
Trying to stay calm.;
Controlling my temper.;
Sheathing my claws.;
(Whistles) Langley can sleep through almost anything. Langley! Your cabin is burning to the ground!;
(Whistles) He is a professional sleeper.;
(Whistles) This place has great acoustics!;
I wonder if the Greybeards have mastered the way of the whistle. I think it is likely.;
(Whistles) Looking good, my friend.;
Hey, Angi. (Appreciative whistle);
(Appreciative whistle) Looking good, Mjoll. Wow.;
Here, Lydia! Lydia! Lydia! Come on, girl! (Whistles);
(Whistles) Come on, Meeko! (Whistles);
(Whistles) Come on, Vigilance! (Whistles);
Fear not, my friend! I am still here.;
Do not worry about me! I will catch up!;
(Whistles) That is probably how a ghost whistles. (Whistles);
There is a very strange sounding bird around here somewhere.;
Mr Dragonfly wishes he could whistle too. I will whistle for the both of us. (Whistles);
Let us try to whistle up a storm. This weather is boring. (Whistles);
Is that your new way of asking me if I want a sweetroll? I would not say no.;
(Whistles) I wonder if we are accidentally conversing with a bird or two. I hope we are not embarrassing ourselves.;
(Whistles) Whistling is fun.;
What's that, my friend? You think I am an amazing companion? I feel the same way about you.;
What's that, my friend? Little Olaf has fallen in the well? Oh no!;
Is that the new signal for let us get out here? I agree completely.;
I would whistle with you but my lips are not in the mood.;
Still following.;
I'm coming! Keep your scales on!;
I'm coming! Keep your hair on!;
What are you trying to tell me?;
I was wondering... Can you whistle?;
Well, it could be a good way for us to quickly communicate. Look, I found this book.;
It made interesting reading. Maybe you should give it a look over.;
Anyway. What did you want to talk about?;
I want to talk about money.;
A necessary evil.;
How can I assist?;
I think you should keep any loot you find.;
Give me any loot you find right away.;
Can you spare any gold?;
No problem. My looting has been going well.;
Of course. I am OK for money at the moment. Here you go.;
I have a little. Here you go.;
Sorry. I am a bit low on funds at the moment. The next time we are profitable area I will see what I can find.;
Errr. No.;
Do you want some gold? I'd like to give you something.;
You are generous but I have a little of my own tucked away. I do not need yours.;
Tucked away? Where do you keep it?;
The same place I keep my bread and writing materials. I will look after any money you want me to carry, but I will not spend it.;
I would rather pay my own way.;
A little. I do not need much.;
I was wondering though, while we are adventuring together would you mind if I did some looting of my own?;
Nothing big, but perhaps if I see a gem stuck in a crack in the ground, or a few gold pieces you have missed, I could keep what I find.;
No. Bring anything you find to me right away.;
Sure. Whatever you find is yours.;
Thank you. Now the possibility of a future exists maybe I should start planning for it.;
Anyway. Did you want to talk about something else?;
Hail there. Seeing our kind doing well in this cold environment warms my heart. I would like to do business with you.;
Hello, friend. I wish to barter with you.;
Excuse me. I am a wealthy noble from a far away land. All this gold I am carrying is heavy. I would like to unburden myself.;
Hello there. I would like to do business.;
Hello. I am here to buy.;
Hello, shopkeeper. I would like to give you some gold.;
All right.;
Hmm hmmm. That seems to be everything. Thank you very much.;
Yes. That seems to be everything. Thank you.;
Here is a list of the things I require. Can you help me out?;
Same to you.;
What have you got there?;
I wanted to buy you something.;
I bought you something. I hope you do not mind.;
Also, take this.;
Do me a favour and heal yourself, OK?;
I noticed you were running low.;
We should keep those magical hands of yours well fed.;
You have to keep your strength up.;
Thank you, Inigo.;
Do not mention it. After everything you have done for me it is the least I can do.;
No problem. It is nice to be able to give something back.;
You are very welcome.;
I didn't ask for this junk.;
It would not have been a gift if you had. I will try to choose better next time. I am sorry.;
Well, it is the thought that counts. Feel free to sell what I have given you. I will not be offended.;
You may call it junk. I call it a gesture of friendship. Do with it what you will.;
I will take it back if you do not want it. I am sorry it is not to your liking.;
I've changed my mind. Your gift was lovely. Thank you.;
I could always use more health potions.;
Magicka potions are usually a safe bet.;
I love stamina potions... just saying.;
In future just get me anything you want. I don't mind.;
You know what I really need? Arrows.;
Right now soul gems are a priority.;
I'm always looking for rare ingredients.;
Some resist magic potions would be useful.;
I'm really into poisoning things at the moment.;
Please don't waste your money on me. I really don't want anything.;
I wouldn't mind a gift once in a while. I've changed my mind.;
My brother and I never knew our real parents. We were found abandoned in a smelly shack by a soldier on his way to battle.;
We melted his heart with our fuzzy little faces and he carried us to the nearest town.;
He deposited us at an orphanage and that is where we spent most of our childhood.;
My brother and I were adopted by a couple of retired assassins. I guess the orphanage did not do a family background check.;
I was bullied by the other Khajiit children because of my unusual colour and markings.;
My mother showed me a handy trick with a rock and a glove. I was never bothered again.;
My father showed my brother and I how to use a sword, my mother taught us the bow. Happy childhood memories.;
I grew up in Riverhold, not far from Cyrodiil. My brother and I headed for the Imperial city to find our fortune when we came of age.;
I found love, for a time at least. My brother found death.;
My mother and father are both gone. They died protecting a trading caravan a few years back. I guess I am an orphan again.;
My brother and I found much work as sellswords. We never made it to the Imperial city but we made a lot of coin.;
I awoke one morning to a lot of noise outside our tent. My brother staggered in bleeding and pushed our father's sword into my hand.;
He said that if I loved him I would run. He used the last of his strength to rip out the back of the tent and push me down the slope beyond.;
Some Khajiit hating locals had blamed us for a spate of robberies in the area and had decided to take the matter into their own hands.;
Twelve of them had snuck up on us in the night. My brother died but I live because of him.;
I was recruited by a group of bandits a few years ago. That is when I discovered Skooma. It was the beginning of a lot of nastiness.;
I was with a bandit girl for while. Turns out that she was using me. She wanted protection not affection.;
As soon as she found someone more psychopathic I was dropped like a sack of troll dung.;
I left the bandits and took the only ally I had with me. He was also an addict but we thought we had it under control.;
His name was Felix. He was a big fellow, good in a scrap. We became mercenaries together.;
After a few months Felix and I had made a little gold but our addiction to skooma was getting in the way.;
No one trusts an addict, my friend, especially not another addict.;
One day Felix burst into my chamber, instinct took over and I reacted. His murder was my second last step on the road of dishonour.;
All right.;
I'd rather you didn't talk with other people while we are travelling together.;
As you wish. I will try not to be too social.;
Sure. As long as I can still talk to you and Mr Dragonfly I do not mind.;
OK. Most people are not worth talking to anyway.;
Feel free to converse with anyone you wish.;
Yes. Good idea. I enjoy getting to know people.;
Understood. I will try to be social.;
Try to fight quietly when I'm sneaking.;
OK. I will attempt to be less vocally exuberant in sneaky situations.;
I will do my best. It is probably a wise plan.;
Don't bother trying to fight quietly when I'm sneaking.;
OK. I will be insulting and distracting.;
Good. I find staying quiet during combat tricky.;
I want you to talk as much as you like.;
Of course. I will speak my mind.;
Could we have less idle chitchat, please?;
No promises but I will certainly try.;
Some things need to be said, but I will do my best.;
I will move. Sorry.;
Moving. My apologies.;
Changing position.;
I will give you some space.;
No problem. Moving.;
Uh huh. Moving.;
Making some room.;
Getting out of your way.;
Finding a new position.;
Moving.;
Any thoughts, Vigilance?;
Vigilance, you are crazy... but adorable.;
Any thoughts, Meeko?;
Meeko, you are insane. If were not so cute you would be in big trouble.;
Langley, thank you so much. The renovations you have made are wonderful.;
Don't mention it. I hope you'll feel at home here.;
I am sure I will.;
No. I have a bed, nice smells, and books to read. I could not ask for more.;
Oh. While we're living together I'd appreciate it if you didn't disturb me while I'm working.;
Noted.;
And no singing after dark please.;
And don't touch my art supplies.;
I was not planning to.;
And do try not to leave hair everywhere. I may be allergic.;
No promises on that one but I will do my best.;
Right. Well, it's lovely having you here. I'll let you settle in.;
He has more rules than a prison, but he clearly went to a lot of trouble. This will suit me fine.;
You haven't lost Inigo have you?;
Do you always go sneaking into other people's homes?;
Come in. I'm guessing it's pretty cold out there.;
Hello there. Feel free to warm yourself by the fire. It must be freezing out there.;
Come in out of the cold. Make yourselves at home.;
Inigo, It's for you.;
Inigo, your friend is here.;
Good morning, Langley.;
Good afternoon, Langley.;
Good evening to you, Langley.;
Hello there, Langley.;
Hello, Langley.;
Good to see you, Langley.;
Hello there, my friend. How are you?;
Hello, my friend. It is nice of you to visit.;
Langley, we are heading out. See you soon.;
Langley. We must be on our way. See you later.;
Cheerio. Try not to get killed.;
Farewell. Look after each other out there.;
Cheerio. Do try to stay alive will you.;
Farewell. Don't take any unnecessary risks.;
The lute in your cell was full of arrows. I take it you prefer singing?;
Yes. I have never been very good though. I enjoy writing songs but sometimes it is more fun just making up words as I go along.;
Improvisation keeps the mind sharp and boredom at bay.;
If I asked, would you sing something while we're travelling?;
There's too much singing in this world already if you ask me.;
An understandable opinion, but it is possible you have just not yet heard the right song. It may find you if you keep your ears open.;
Well, I know it is silly but my songs are special to me. I would rather perform them in a special place.;
However, if you just want me to improvise something while we are travelling, maybe I can help you out.;
I really doubt it.;
Ah well. You are picky about what you put in your ears. That is probably a good thing.;
Maybe you're right. If I asked, would you sing something while we're travelling?;
Thank you... but to be honest I don't have much use for this.;
Ah well. I will try to make a better selection in future. I am sorry.;
Sorry. For future reference is there anything in particular you require?;
I will take it back if you do not want it. I am sorry it is not to your liking.;
Well, that says a lot more about you and our friendship than it does about the colour of my fur. Those who I am close to only tend to only see me.;
Those who enjoy trying to make others feel worthless are worthless to me. They usually lack any remarkability of their own.;
All they can offer the world is bile. I do not worry too much about the opinions of the heartless and cruel.;
The worst part, the reason I cannot wholly ignore my strangeness, is the reactions from those who do not even know they are reacting.;
Let's leave it there for now.;
As I am sure you know, how someone appears can largely determine how they are treated by other people.;
A physically beautiful person usually lives in a world with a great many courtesies and smiles.;
On the other hand, a seemingly unusual individual often exists in a realm of awkward glances, disdain, and sometimes open hostility.;
I gain nothing from ignoring this fact. Whenever I notice a negative reaction, I try to bear my uniqueness in mind.;
Ignorance is regrettable but it is not a crime. Anyway, I am at peace with my appearance now.;
I have grown into it. I no longer dwell on what makes me different, but, I am aware that I am.;
We were talking about the colour of your fur. Carry on.;
I'm not exactly normal myself, Inigo.;
I am glad it is so. I like you just the way you are. I suppose we are all strange to someone, my friend.;
Unfortunately certain people will always distrust what they do not understand.;
If you could change your colour right now would you?;
Maybe, but I doubt it. As Fergus used to say, it is a good idiot detector.;
My colouring does not define who I am to me. That is what is important, I think.;
I agree, you blue abomination. Let's talk of other things.;
OK, dog breath. Whatever you say.;
OK, you dirty bloodsucker. Whatever you say.;
OK, dragon-lover. Whatever you say.;
OK, smelly. Whatever you say.;
Good talk, Inigo. Let's change the subject.;
What do you wish to discuss.;
You're a freak, my friend. Let's leave it there.;
You say it like it is a bad thing.;
What do you wish to discuss.;
What do you want out of life?;
Are you talking about some sort of final goal?;
I am not sure. Happiness would be nice but I would settle for contentment. Maybe this new path I am on will lead me there.;
Despite my turbulent existence, life is pretty good at the moment. I am not eager to race towards a conclusion of some sort.;
No. What do you want right now?;
I want to continue this pleasing conversation with my friend. I also want to empty my bladder, but that can wait.;
To be honest, I believe I may have a chance at happiness. Right now I want to protect and nurture that chance every day. If I can.;
How about you? What do you want out of life?;
I want peace and happiness.;
Well, you have certainly earned it.;
The most noble quest of all.;
It is a shame that to achieve a peaceful existence fighting is so often necessary.;
It may take time but I have a feeling that you will get what you want.;
I want power and wealth.;
I am sure you will have more of both in no time.;
You already have quite a bit of both.;
Power and wealth are attractive goals but watch they do not consume you.;
You may find yourself destitute and powerless in other more important areas.;
I don't want to be forgotten. I want to live a life worthy of songs and stories.;
Mission accomplished, my friend. You saved this world from annihilation.;
You are a remarkable individual. You will be remembered.;
The echoes of your exploits will reverberate throughout eternity. I am sure of it.;
Anyway. Being a part of your present is pretty fantastic. I hope there is a little room for me in your future as well.;
Our friendship has made my world a brighter place.;
I have just thought of something.;
You know what would be really nice?;
It is just an image that came into my mind. You may think it is silly.;
I see two elderly battle-scared companions visiting each other. Their families are there, all laughing and talking.;
It is raining, but the old friends choose to sit outside under a canopy and talk of times gone by. They have lived colourful and worthwhile lives.;
As the rain pours down, releasing lovely green smells from the land these two spent their lives protecting, they drink to each other and smile.;
Soon their families will call them indoors, and they will go happily enough, but for now they are as they always have been.;
The best of friends, side by side, enjoying each other's company.;
I think that would be a future worth fighting for.;
I really don't care.;
Sounds good to me. I hope it comes to pass.;
Yes. That makes two of us.;
I hope I die before I get old.;
As the years go by you may revise that opinion. Maybe not. We will see.;
Let us get back to the here and now. Is there something else you wanted to talk about?;
Do you remember the Khajiit that attacked us while we were looking for the elder scroll?;
My throat is on fire and my nose is leaking. Other than that I am OK.;
My back was playing up a bit earlier but it is easing now.;
I am a little gassy today but other than that all is well.;
I am a little tired but other than that all is well.;
I am enjoying this weather.;
I am wishing we were not in Windhelm, but all in all I am OK.;
I could use some warm footwear but other than that I am OK.;
I do not enjoy carrying this skooma around but other than that I am OK.;
All things considered I am doing well.;
How is everything with you?;
I'm good, thank you.;
OK. You smell hungry. I hope you do not want to suck my blood.;
You do not want to chase a stick or something?;
You do not smell good. You smell ill. Ah well, as long as you feel all right that is the main thing.;
I am happy to hear it.;
Let us talk of other things.;
I'm not doing so well.;
I am sorry to hear that. What is wrong, my friend?;
I am sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it?;
What makes you think you are so tasty?;
Fleas seem to think I am. If you are saying I am not appetizing I am relieved.;
I'll be honest, sometimes you look delicious.;
I see. Well, please try to restrain yourself. I am not on the menu.;
I have no desire to be a meal for anyone. Not even you.;
How does it feel? Being a vampire, I mean... Not being eaten.;
It feels fantastic!;
Not good. I wouldn't recommend it.;
Oh dear. That is a shame. I am sure it can be reversed.;
I can turn invisible, raise the dead, and I'm immune to poison.;
That is impressive. I can see the attraction.;
It just does. I can't explain why exactly.;
Words are feeble things. I suppose it is something you really need to experience to fully understand.;
On second thoughts I need help. I hate being a vampire!;
Oh dear. That is a shame. I am sure it can be reversed.;
Maybe you should try it? It really is wonderful.;
I would miss the sun. I would hate being dependent on another substance after my dealings with skooma.;
I do not enjoy the smell of death, and I like my teeth the way they are, thank you very much.;
I appreciate your understanding.;
Anyway, I feel this conversation is making you hungry. Maybe we should change the subject.;
Have you looked into a cure?;
I have heard there is a vampire expert in Morthal. Perhaps we should pay him a visit.;
Maybe I'll look into that. Thanks.;
No problem. We will have you sorted in no time.;
I spoke to an expert in Morthal. He told me to find a filled black soul gem.;
We already have one. Let us get you back to the land of the living as soon as possible.;
We should search for one as soon as possible. In the mean time try not to eat me.;
Falion in Morthal is rumored to have studied vampires.  He may be able to help.;
Good. We will have you sorted in no time.;
Was that a werewolf joke?;
Yes. I am sorry. I could not resist.;
You do know what wolves do to cats right?;
They chase them... unsuccessfully.;
You are not amused. I am sorry.;
To be honest I rather like werewolves.;
They are fantastic warriors and they do not smell as bad as some people say.;
I have often wondered, how does it feel when you change form?;
I am sorry to hear that. It must be worth it though.;
I feel unstoppable.;
You are unstoppable, and pretty terrifying to behold.;
I am interested. What is the best part about being a skinchanger in your opinion?;
The increased speed and sense of power.;
Rushing across the plains, the wind in your fur, frightening deer and farmers. It sounds good.;
Not having to think is pretty great. Kill this, eat that. It makes life simple.;
I imagine that is true. I hope you do not lose the ability to recognise your friends though.;
If you can only hold one thought in your shaggy head make it 'Do not eat Inigo.';
Actually, sometimes I wish I wasn't a werewolf.;
This may sound strange, my friend, but there are worse things you could be.;
I quite enjoy having a giant ferocious beast on my side.;
You should find a cure if you are not happy, but for what it is worth, I think you make a fantastic werewolf.;
Would you ever want to become a werewolf, Inigo?;
It would be better than being a vampire that is for sure, but no. I am happy as I am.;
After what my mind has already endured, taking it off the leash, as it were, could be a very bad idea.;
We will all be better off if I remain in a more controlled state.;
I think you should try it.;
My mind is made up. It would not be wise.;
I understand. It's not for everyone.;
Indeed. You wear it better than I ever could.;
Now, is it time for walkies or shall we talk of other things?;
I'm worried about the tasks ahead.;
After everything you have already been through I doubt future events will give you any trouble.;
The future is unwritten but look at what you have already accomplished. You will succeed. It is what you do.;
I do not know what the future holds but I believe in your ability. If anyone can succeed it is you.;
I lost someone dear to me.;
The brutality of grief. I know it well.;
I'm feeling down today.;
Are you a little low or drowning in a pool of hopelessness?;
I could use some cheering up. How about an amusing anecdote?;
Let's see. Errr...;
To be honest I'd rather we spoke about something else.;
Of course. Remember I am always here if you want to talk.;
Of course. Remember I am always here if you need me.;
I once put a dead spider in bed with Fergus while he was snoozing. My mother walked in, saw the spider and screamed.;
When I was very young Fergus buried me in the garden. My mother found me with my head sticking out of the ground.;
The first time I saw a mammoth I thought she would make an imposing steed. I clambered up onto her back but she went crazy and tried to throw me off.;
I did not blame her and I would have dismounted but my foot got tangled in a clump of her shaggy hair.;
My best friend and I once saved the world from a giant ugly lizard called Alduin. We killed him in Sovngarde.;
You have probably heard songs about our adventure. Anyway, the whole time the battle was going on I thought I was dreaming. Pretty funny, eh?;
One evening when I was with the bandits, I was out patrolling our camp near a forest while everyone else was on a raid.;
I saw something move near by, so I raised my torch and peered into the trees.;
It is funny the things you mishear as a child. For twelve years I thought that princesses had hairy godmothers. It made sense to me.;
The noise awoke my brother.;
Startled, he sat bolt upright, simultaneously banging his head on the bottom of my bunk, and launching the dead spider across the room.;
My mother deflected the flying spider into the hearth and it went up in flames.;
Fergus rolled out of bed onto the floor unconscious. That is when my father came home.;
I had some major explaining to do.;
I'm not in the mood for this story. Could you pick another one?;
At the time I thought it was hilarious.;
My father did not think so, but yes it still makes me smile.;
Anyway, everyone was OK and that night I found a charred spider in my bed, so Fergus got his own back.;
She said at first she thought I was a blue cabbage. Anyway, Fergus strolled over with a bucket and started to water me.;
'What are you doing?' said my mother. Fergus looked up at her and replied, 'I am helping him grow. I want a bigger brother.';
My mother told us that our method would only enlarge my head and suggested Fergus dig me out in a hurry.;
He ignored her advice. If my head is a little big, now you now why.;
I doubt it did any lasting damage.;
I know but it is still fun to think about.;
So, that's why you think so highly of yourself.;
Yes. Blame Fergus.;
What if I fail?;
Ifs, buts, and maybes, my friend. They often kill success before it has had a chance.;
Fail or win, none of your doubts will matter in the long run. All you can do is try. As long as you do that there is hope.;
I don't know if I'm strong enough.;
Of course you are.;
There are many ways in which someone can be strong, but above all else it is willpower and spirit that tend to win through.;
You have a lot of both.;
There's something else on my mind I want to talk about.;
Of course. Remember I am always here if you want to talk.;
What if I don't want to try anymore?;
That is your choice. Perhaps another brave soul will take on the challenge in your stead.;
You may be the most capable but without the will to act that means very little.;
Do you want to give up?;
Then try. Win or lose, I will be with you all the way.;
Yes. Sometimes.;
That is only natural. You must do what your heart tells you but do not live in fear of failure. I will have your back either way.;
For what it is worth, there are usually less regrets down the path of action. It is your choice in the end, but I say go for it.;
And I have you by my side.;
Yes. Always. As if you were not already unstoppable enough.;
There are limits to my strength, Inigo.;
That may be true, but your adaptability is unsurpassed. As a result your limits are dwindling.;
There is nothing you cannot handle. Count on it.;
I am sorry for your loss.;
I feel helpless.;
If only there were a way to turn back time. Alas, we cannot. We can remember though. At least we have that.;
The joyful agony we feel when we recall the loved and lost is important. It describes their significance even in death.;
I can't believe they're gone.;
Indeed. Even now it is hard to accept I will never see Fergus or my parents again.;
I cannot control that, but they are a part of me still. They are in every tear, every song, and every smile.;
I believe I am lucky to have been gifted knowledge of their souls before they passed on, but sometimes it is a heavy gift to bear.;
I miss them so much.;
I know, my friend. I know. You probably always will, but it does get a little easier. Trust me.;
I should have been nicer to them.;
Maybe, but people are often sharpest with those they care for. If they meant a lot to you, the chances are you meant a lot to them.;
Not everyone is good at showing appreciation, but we all feel it I think. That is what is important. That is what endures.;
I never got the chance to say... many things.;
Yes. It is horrible. When I said goodbye to my parents I did not think it would be forever.;
Maybe I am kidding myself but I believe they knew or suspected what was never said. Perhaps the same is true for you.;
Anyway, I now try to tell those I care about how much they mean to me whenever I get the chance. It seems wise.;
They can't be gone.;
They live on in you, my friend. The ripples they sent out as they went through life are still being felt.;
They are alive every time you talk or think about them. Never forget that.;
Life seems so much harder without them.;
That is a wonderful compliment to them. What do you think they would tell you if they were here now?;
They would tell me to keep my chin up and get on with life.;
Easy for them to say, but it is probably good advice.;
They would tell me to pull myself together and stop whining.;
A little harsh, but who am I to argue. They clearly had your best interests at heart.;
They would tell me they're still watching over me.;
Well then, you had better be on your best behaviour.;
Anyway. They clearly loved you very much.;
They would tell me they loved me and that death cannot change that.;
That is beautiful.;
They seem to be alive and well in you. Remember them but try not to let grief drag you down.;
It will always be there, but you can make room for it. Those we cared about in life would not want to be a burden in death. I am sure of it.;
It shouldn't get easier.;
But it does. That is no slight on the departed. It is just the way it is.;
You will always miss them, but in time those feelings are no longer all encompassing. Hard to imagine now, but it is true.;
In time maybe, but right now it hurts.;
It is an ache like no other that is for sure. When Fergus passed I thought the pain was going to rip me in two. I suppose it did in a way.;
Those we have lost take a piece of us with them when they go I think. All we can do is try to ensure that what grows in its place is not detrimental.;
Easier said than done. If I can help in any way let me know.;
The grief, it's like a physical pain.;
Yes it is. It is the reason I turned to skooma. Hiding from that anguish does not work though.;
It is better to let it out if you can, when you are ready.;
I sometimes forget they're gone then it hits me.;
That happens to me too. When it does I try to remember them during some happy moment. It dulls the pain a little.;
I remember my mother and father reading to me, taking turns to do the voices in the story. How they made each other laugh.;
I remember Fergus getting his head caught in a basket and us both rolling about giggling trying to free him.;
I remember family hunting trips and the look of pride and amazement on my mother's face when I shot my first bird out of the sky.;
When I forget then realize my family are gone I visit them in these memories. It is a poor substitute but a lot better than nothing.;
Everything seems pointless.;
You only feel despair? Everything else is numb?;
I just don't feel like doing anything.;
I hate that feeling. Everything is too much trouble and your brain feels like it is stuck in the mud or something.;
I was wondering why you did not get dressed this morning. Now it makes sense.;
Well, you managed to get dressed this morning. That is quite an achievement.;
For me at least the feeling comes and goes.;
When it is bad, forcing myself into action is almost impossible, but if I manage to get going things become a little easier.;
Yes. Something like that.;
A nasty place to be. I do not know about you, but for me that feeling is often made worse by a sense of emotional isolation.;
You are not alone, my friend.;
Thank you, Inigo.;
I wish I could take your pain away. I know I cannot, but talking about it often helps a little.;
Sometimes I feel like giving up.;
I've been there and I made it through to the other side. So will you.;
More than ever I now believe that despite all the pain and suffering it is a wondrous thing that we exist.;
There is still meaning and joy in the world. You may find it, you may not, but for as long as you are here there is hope and endless possibilities.;
What if I always feel this way?;
That is very unlikely.;
On the other hand it is possible that all you will ever feel in this life, good and bad, is but a brief splash in an infinite ocean of nothing.;
That makes our time here a gift too precious to waste in my opinion.;
It may sound strange but I have come to see beauty in almost everything. All the love, all the suffering, all the smiles, all the hate.;
I am in awe of existence itself. No matter how much it hurts I do not want to miss a moment.;
Maybe I should just go back to bed.;
Or we could go for a walk or talk about something amusing.;
Distractions sometimes help.;
Yes. I find that too, if my attention span is not also suffering. You know, I can be pretty distracting.;
Sorry. I'm not in the mood.;
I understand. When I feel down, having someone forcibly try to elevate my mood is just annoying.;
Anyone who tells you to simply cheer up in that state fails to grasp the situation.;
It is not a cure, but exploring a dungeon or killing some chickens works far better in my experience.;
I am sad you sad. I hope you feel better soon.;
I swung up and down as she ran this way and that in a frenzy.;
Finally she smashed me against a tree and everything went black.;
When I awoke I found myself in a confusion of branches about fifteen feet off the ground.;
A travelling merchant was staring up at me. 'What happened to you?' he asked.;
'Nothing. I am just doing a little tree climbing.' I replied. I was ashamed.;
'Is that some sort of Khajiit tree-climbing boot?' he asked.;
I glanced down and saw a massive knot of mammoth fur covering one of my feet.;
Yes.' I said. 'It is pretty effective as you can see.' The merchant offered to buy my amazing tree-climbing boot.;
I accepted his offer and went on my way. I often wonder how much he sold it for.;
How much did he pay you?;
Fifty gold pieces. Accepting that money was the price of dignity.;
I would have told him the truth.;
It is a lot funnier in hindsight. At the time my embarrassment got the better of me.;
I wish I knew what happened to the poor mammoth. I hope her hair grew back.;
You were in Sovngarde? That's insane! I don't believe it.;
It is hard to believe, I grant you, but it happened. My friend and I are heroes of the highest order.;
And was this friend of yours as capable as you?;
More or less. The stories tend to focus on them for some reason but I also played a vital role.;
I'm honoured to be your presence, O great adventurer.;
I should hope so. You are very lucky to meet me in person.;
I want to hear more about this companion of yours.;
All you need to know is that she has the best taste in friends. Personally I believe that is what has kept her alive so long.;
All you need to know is that he has the best taste in friends. Personally I believe that is what has kept him alive so long.;
I know this story well. Let's speak of other things.;
OK. Our adventure sounds a little unlikely when I describe it out loud.;
I'm glad I got to share it with you.;
It was an honour. We work well together.;
Your involvement was unlikely.;
Yes it was. I am often unexpected. I like it that way.;
There were ten heavily armed warriors staring back at me. Two of them had arrows aimed at my head.;
I was about to duck when a searing pain engulfed my arm and I let out a yell of agony.;
I had accidentally set myself on fire with my torch.;
I ran about screaming, waving my flaming arm in the air. Eventually I spotted a large puddle and extinguished myself.;
I then searched about for the warriors. They were clearly getting ready to launch an attack but they were nowhere to be seen.;
Later, when my group returned they suggested we move camp.;
They had heard tales of a flaming, shrieking ghost stalking the woods and asked me if I had seen anything.;
I said that had seen something burning among the trees, but I never told them it was me.;
I can see why you kept that one to yourself.;
I am pretty sure you have spent more time on fire than me, my friend, but yes. It was not my finest moment.;
Yes. It was not my finest moment.;
I wonder if people are still scared of the flaming ghost in those woods.;
I hope so. I enjoy the idea of being a spooky legend. Even if it was a misunderstanding.;
Anyway. I kept my arm covered until the hair grew back and no one was the wiser.;
When you are living with a group of bandits, reputation is everything.;
I also went through most of my early life wondering what a crofe was.;
People would say things like 'The cave is nearby. Maybe two miles as the crofe lies.';
I assumed a crofe was some sort of creature known for lying about distance.;
Language can be confusing sometimes.;
You're an idiot, Inigo.;
Maybe. I do tend to creatively misinform myself, that is for sure.;
I've made similar mistakes myself.;
Sometimes I worry that there are other phrases I still misunderstand. Ah well. No harm no owl.;
Do you believe in destiny?;
Yes. I mean no... It is complicated.;
I believe that we have a bit of control within the choices available to us.;
We may be more or less likely choose one thing or another, but I do not think the future is entirely written. Therefore we are not bound by destiny.;
Langley's predictions seem to back this up somewhat.;
I don't know. I think we each have a place we are undoubtedly heading.;
Maybe you are right. However, saying we either get where we want to be or it was not destined to happen removes individual responsibility.;
I can see why this is an attractive notion, but I would rather own my successes and failures.;
Even if choice is an illusion, I choose to live as though it is not.;
I agree. I believe we forge our own destinies to some degree.;
Maybe it is a bit of both, yes.;
Of course we cannot control much of what makes us who we are, but to say our lives are entirely predetermined seems a little much.;
We may not be able to control what we think in a given moment, but I think we can often decide which thoughts to act on.;
I think we were destined to have this conversation.;
I think it was likely that we would have this conversation as long as additional random factors gave us a helping hand. Which they did.;
We don't choose what influences us so maybe we can't alter where we end up.;
OK, but I believe you could have chosen to leave me in my cell.;
Were you always going to let me join you because your life made you into a person who would?;
Was it destiny? I am not sure it was a sure thing.;
It is an interesting subject. If we are bound by destiny, do we have any control at all? If so where does it begin and end?;
Were you always going to find all eight eggs for Langley, or could you have called it a day at six?;
Were you never going to find all those eggs for Langley, or could you have chosen to continue searching?;
I have seen many people who blame their poor circumstances on fate. I have also seen people successfully change their situations for the better.;
Was that destiny also? Perhaps, but when the word describes either outcome it becomes meaningless to me.;
I believe in destiny overall, but maybe it is subject to change.;
I see. Then I suppose a destiny is just a potential destination. It is a prediction based on events up until the present.;
I know what you mean. It does seem like a meaningless concept.;
When taken literally, yes.;
Now that I think about it, when I talk about destiny in every day life I am really referring to probability...;
I think. To be honest I am not sure anymore.;
Let us leave this topic for now, my friend. It is making my head hurt.;
A few septims for my supper is all I ask... You're kinda fuzzy. What's wrong with ya?;
I was born fuzzy. Here, take this. It is not for alcohol, OK?;
Here. It is not much but I hope it helps.;
I can spare a little gold. Here you are, friend.;
Divines bless you. Thank you.;
No problem. Go buy something to eat.;
You are welcome. Be safe.;
My pleasure. May your luck rise.;
My pleasure. I wish I could do more.;
We aught to dig a big hole. Throw all them dark elves and argonians in it, and let them tear each other to pieces.;
Go peddle your hatred elsewhere, you intolerant idiot.;
Try to make me leave. I dare you.;
Your mouth will be the death of you. Go, before I shut it forever.;
You are nothing more than a frightened fool. Maybe I should put you out of your misery.;
Don't hurt me. Just leave me alone.;
I didn't mean nothing by it. Just leave me alone.;
Moron.;
Savages. Out of my way outsider. I swear...;
Every time I see your head I want to twist it off.;
Be quiet.;
I... see. That won't be necessary. Gold solves most problems, doesn't it?;
I'm sorry, what?;
Now, scurry away before I lose my temper.;
Look. I assure you this is all just a huge misunderstanding.;
You can't scare me into submission.;
He he. Look at him go.;
He he. Fun.;
I certainly do.;
Do you enjoy having teeth?;
Buffoon.;
Arghhh! It is OK. It is OK. You still seem to have all your limbs and you are not bleeding or anything.;
It was just a little surprising to witness. I am sure you are all right... Maybe.;
If there is such a thing I wonder what story it tells... and who carved it.;
Maybe we will find your wall next to Alduin's Wall. That would be weird. Perhaps everyone is carving their own wall without realizing it.;
Why are we talking about walls? We need to stay focused!;
Sorry. I enjoy walls. Do not get me started on ceilings. Anyway, let us get back to it.;
What if we are all chisels scratching our own furrows across time?;
Yes! What if time is like a big wall of stone covered with millions of scratches?;
Maybe we all carve a furrow as we experience our own tiny sections of the same gigantic wall!;
What if all those scratches always existed?;
What if from the right perspective time is happening all at once? Yes. Maybe we are not carving. Maybe we are just following a path!;
...And time is merely our method of transport!;
Let us get back to whatever it was we were doing... Wow.;
I thought he would be.;
To me that seems an odd assumption to make. I wish I had your powers of deductive reasoning. Wow.;
You and me both!;
If that happens you'll have to get in line.;
Understood. Let us hope she has been busy elsewhere. To be honest I doubt she could handle this place.;
I know you will. You are quite an inspiration.;
If you were not you would be insane. I know you will be OK though. You always are.;
Remember to summon me when you reach your destination. I want to see this through to the end if possible.;
Stick Alduin in the eye for me, OK? I will see you when this is over.;
Look after yourself, my friend. Do you need anything from me before you go?;
Do you ever wish we didn't have to fight so much?;
Fighting is one of the few things I am good at, but yes, sometimes I wish my talent was not so necessary.;
I do enjoy the feeling of serene focus that descends during battle though. For a while all other thoughts are absent and I just... am.;
Unless I am being attacked by a horrid monstrosity that is.;
I wish it were not so, but cannot remain composed around certain enemies. Battle is less enjoyable when my mind is fighting fear.;
When we are tested against out nightmares it takes more bravery than ever to make a stand.;
When I am fighting a group of zombies all I want to do is run. That I do not indicates that I am pretty brave fellow, I think.;
We are all courageous in our own way. If someone says they are not frightened by anything they may lack imagination.;
Anyway, I do enjoy fighting for the most part. There is nothing like the rush of beating a powerful opponent.;
After a tough battle I feel more alive than ever. How about you?;
Fighting is necessary but I can't say I enjoy it.;
I understand. It is a shame you have to do battle when your heart is not in it. You fight a good fight though.;
Maybe it is your aversion to combat that makes you so capable. You get the job done with no silly messing around. That is to be applauded.;
You and me both. With the way the world is it is a good thing too. Combat may be brutal and dangerous but it is also exhilarating.;
I may not enjoy every fight, but if our time together has taught me anything it is that every fight by your side is worth it.;
You hauled yourself out of the shadow of despair and into the light.;
I could not have done that without you, my friend, but yes I now walk a better path that is for sure.;
You are a good man, Inigo. That is enough.;
Errm...;
I suppose that now I am no longer a drug addled thug there is hope for me yet.;
That is a lovely thing to say. Thank you. I hope it is true.;
I have heard it said that you can judge a man by the quality of his company. If that is correct maybe I am doing all right after all.;
I appreciate the talk. I feel a little better. Anyway, enough about me. How are you doing?;
Yes. His mind had gone.;
Indeed. He was suffering from skooma withdrawal. He was talking to his dead brother when we found him.;
No. Remind me.;
He was talking to his dead brother when we found him. He was suffering from skooma withdrawal. He attacked us in a frenzy.;
Anyway, he was a pitiful wretch. He reminded me of my past self. It has been on my mind ever since. I am lucky to have escaped a similar fate.;
Maybe the khajiit was in a similar predicament when he started his habit.;
He may have had a choice but perhaps long ago he was in a place where taking skooma was as involuntary as a yawn or a sneeze.;
Someone's circumstance and nature do play a part I think. Those factors are often beyond our control.;
We never know how we will respond to certain situations until they are upon us.;
Indeed. When most people see someone down on their luck they tend to assume they would never be in the same position.;
They may be right but sometimes we make bad choices that do not seem like choices at all at the time.;
Sometimes we need a little help to make the right choice.;
Yes. I am lucky you asked me to join you when you did.;
That khajiit was a silly skooma-head who chose the life he got.;
Yes. Well, he was a sorry sight whatever the case. He was alone and he did not even know it.;
You made the choice to join me. You could have said no.;
We both played a part, it is true.;
Yes you are.;
Very wise of you to know it. Maybe later then.;
Play your cards right and maybe we will take you hunting one day.;
I am pretty fantastic, it is true.;
You smell funny.;
Maybe you have what it takes after all. If it is the future you really want I am sure you can make it happen.;
I am sorry. I will try not to bother you. Geesh.;
If you've the coin then you've come to the right place.;
You look like you could use a drink.;
The dead are welcome to it if you ask me. I just want to get out of this place.;
(Pfttttttt);
Indeed. Best to keep clear.;
You are telling me! Phew! My poor nose.;
What have you been eating? My nose wants to kill itself. Phew!;
No wonder. That would have dropped a dragon.;
Erik. Sometimes it is good to yell during battle. It puts enemies on the wrong foot. Why don't you give it a shot? Give us your best battle cry.;
Erik, let us hear how your battle cry is coming along.;
All right.;
Whenever you are ready.;
It needs a little work I am afraid. Keep at it.;
Now you're being ridiculous.;
Ah such a fine day. Smell the air. Isn't it wonderful?;
Do not worry. We will be warm again soon enough. It is not so bad.;
You are doing well, slayer. Keep up the good work.;
I suppose we do. You still have a bit to learn though. Stay focused.;
Of course. Just remember there is no shame in realizing when you have met your match.;
Hmm. Yes. You do raise a good point.;
Erik, remind me. What made you want to become an adventurer?;
How is it working out for you?;
I guess I'm doing all right. I need this to go well.;
Stick with it. You will be fine.;
It is all right. I am sure it was an accident. I forgive you.;
Hey Erik. We should go hunting soon. Maybe work on your archery?;
All right then. I will keep an eye out for signs of our quarry.;
Yes. So are some of the locals no doubt.;
You will be all right. Just keep an eye out for traps.;
A decent amount.;
Oh no you don't. I will place you under arrest first! For extreme acts of idiocy!;
You will? Oh no.;
Sarcasm does not suit you, Lydia. Maybe stock up on brains instead.;
He he. OK. That was very quick witted of you. Bravo. It appears I have proved my original point.;
I feel the same way, you big dummy. Let us get back to it.;
All right.;
How are you feeling? That was quite a night... I think.;
Urgggh. Ow.;
Me too. It feels like a dragon relieved himself in my head.;
I feel fine.;
I wish I could say the same. I think you may still be under the influence.;
This is why I do not usually drink heavily. I wonder what came over me.;
"Did I ever! The last thing I recall is you saying ""Go on! You are still blue! Drink more.""";
Then there was a lot of running in the dark and laughing. Beyond that I only remember fragments.;
We survived a drunken night with a daedric prince. Wow. We know how to have a good time, my friend... or so the evidence suggests.;
Let's keep the events of that night between us, OK?;
Yes. I will not mention the hagraven and you forget about the goat.;
Agreed.;
Now, fancy a drink?;
You are a Companion. Well done. You cannot have too many allies, my friend. Especially skilfully violent ones.;
I hope you are feeling OK, my friend. You smell feral.;
These are people of action. Do not hold back, my friend. They will not respect you for it.;
So, we need to go to Dustman's Cairn to prove your honour. I am sure you will pass the test easily. Maybe I can prove my honour at the same time.;
Do we have all the hag's heads we need? Maybe we should collect more while we are here.;
My friend, I implore you, do not propose to any of the hags we meet in here. Try to restrain yourself. Hehehe.;
I think Peryite left a mark on me. I am unwell.;
I tried taking a cure disease potion earlier but it made me feel worse.;
Here, use this cure disease potion.;
I gave you a cure disease potion. Drink it.;
So you did. Thank you. I will give it a try.;
Here goes.;
(Gulp) Nyah.;
I didn't appreciate your rudeness earlier.;
I don't appreciate your inability to pay attention. I already apologised for my... initial greeting. It is not my fault you weren't listening.;
Anyway, we're wasting time. I need to talk to Inigo and you, (sigh) if you would be so kind, need to find those eggs.;
"""I like Skyrim very much. To Oblivion with those who don't."" Inigo the Brave";
"""You Dark Elves are good with magic, yes? You handle the fancy stuff and I'll stick to stabbing people with pointy things. "" Inigo the Brave";
"""Nasty magic! Get your Dragonskin on, my friend!"" Inigo the Brave";
"""If these walls had a voice I think they would scream and scream and scream. "" Inigo the Brave";
"""You've been caught doing something frowned upon quite a few times. Comes with the territory I'm afraid."" Inigo the Brave";
